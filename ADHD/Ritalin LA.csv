"Ritalin LA","CD","August 3, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Trialled Ritalin dosages of 10/20/30mg LA over the course of 4-5 months after trying various doses of IR.  Preferred that it was less extreme than IR in terms of ups &amp; downs and increased energy but sadly, it negatively impacted sleep, heart rate, anxiety and worst of all,  I had less tolerance for people and conversation. Would only take this as a last resort as the cons outweighed the pros but appreciate everyone has different chemistry.",5,4,1
"Ritalin LA","Xavier","April 11, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","The day I took ritalin LA I could channel all I needed to do within a day. I felt extremely happy and open minded. Socially my anxiety was cured and my energy focused to what was most important to me. It is good to take it daily and withdrawing dosages for a while to achieve the same dopamine release/ combat tolerance.",10,6,1
"Ritalin LA","Nelly","March 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I like to take this medication because it gives me the energy to do what I have to. I am unable to walk without a walker. Doctors haven't found the cause. I have tried opiates and they only work for a short time. Now I found that for unknown reasons this medication makes me feel so much better. For whatever reasons it just works for me. I tried the dissolving pills and now I was able to get the Ritalin LA.",9,3,1
"Ritalin LA","Omki","January 15, 2018","-","I  have tried it for 2 months one day I took it I couldn't feel anything (like helping me concentrate) all of what I just felt was the side effects",2,0,1
"Ritalin LA","Mojo90","December 12, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","The first 1 month on LA 20mg were horrible. Anxiety and way too focused. I nearly quit taking it but decided to persist. I am very glad I did.  I now feel fantastic and not so anxious. I would definitely recommend. I have tried all types of Ritalin and concerta and so far this is the one that works for me the best. It also works great with my Anti-depressant. Double Win :)",0,8,1
"Ritalin LA","Ells Bells","August 30, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Thinking that there has been a misdiagnosis as Ritalin had the opposite to that promised.  Violence, aggressive tendencies and amplified mood swings, far worse than before.  When not screetching, behaviour was loopy, super-happy and still unfocused.  Ceased 4 weeks into a 6 week trial - by necessity.",0,5,1
"Ritalin LA","trouble61","May 29, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","At 55 years of age I am diagnosed with ADHD.  It was something I always knew about myself (have Bsc Psych).  However, historic issues of sexual abuse at school caused issues / depression / PTSD.  I was first given Citalopram and diazepam.  I cannot say with certainty it helped a lot.  However, once diagnosed with adult ADHD I was prescribed Ritalin LA. It has been nothing short of a miracle for me. Up early, happier, and getting on with life as best I can. Some minor side effects went away as I continued. Also changed to a decent DE-CAFF coffee.  Caffinated make me anxious and cancels the positives. Was easy to do. I see Ritalin LA as a positive for my depression.",9,14,1
"Ritalin LA","Kenny 1527","October 24, 2016","-","I found out about 5 years ago I had a sleeping disorder. I would fall asleep driven seating at Red lights and even at work. I never wanted to do anything but sleep. But now my Dr. Has me on Methylphenidate er 24 hr 40mg. Once a day and also ritilin 20mgs once a day. And now I can drive and work and not be scared to fall asleep. So now I can get on with my life and do things with my wife and sons and not want to sleep. It has changed my life for the best.",9,6,1
"Ritalin LA","Rednax","February 27, 2016","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This medication is truly life changing. After 30 minutes of taking the medication, I become a different person. My laziness goes away and I feel so focussed to do tasks.  I've seen a friend at school go from almost a washout, to a hardworking student and everyone started feeling different about him. Best medication in the world!",10,22,1
"Ritalin LA","bror95","December 10, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I have been using Ritalin for 5 years, at first it helped me in social situations. Now I use it to concentrate. The 40mg capsule with release holds for 7 hours, only downside is that I loose my appetite for those 7 hours. I went from being an almost dropout in elementary to a high achiever in high school. Now I am in university and ritalin definitely helped me.",10,14,1
"Ritalin LA","db19","November 21, 2015","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Was put on this drug roughly a year ago started at 20mg  it litterarally turned my life around It gave me great symptom relief all day with little to no side effects unfortunately after 6 months this medication slowly lost  it's effectiveness I am now on 80mg a day and only get roughly 2-3 hour symptom relief which is dissapointing but expected due to tolerance so I will be changing medication soon. But I have to say while it worked ritalin la was the best medication i have been on yet with very little side effects..",7,14,1
"Ritalin LA","Kade 2015","January 30, 2015","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Ritalin excellent medication boost ability to focus (minus  out thoughts which bounce off each other at 0-60 second speeds) Quite calming.",9,15,1
"Ritalin LA","Anonymous","June 30, 2011","-","I take Ritalin for ADD. I have found that Ritalin LA offers all of the concentration with none of the nasty side-effects of the SR form of the pill.  The only downside is if your dose is too high that it doesn't wear off as quickly. Makes for a jittery day. Start low and move up.",10,25,1
"Ritalin LA","SunshineSA","May 15, 2011","-","I've been taking this drug for almost a year now and I find it to be extremely helpful. I only wish I had been taking this medication since middle school. I feel no side effects and it has really helped me focus on my day to day tasks.",9,18,1
"Ritalin LA","Anonymous","April 13, 2009","-","Worked great from day one. Unfortunately, does not come in a generic form so can be very expensive. My doctor recently switched me to Methylin ER since it comes in a generic form and is much more affordable.  Sometimes I can't even tell I have taken the Methylin ER, the performance is so sub-standard to the Ritalin LA.  I am starting to think a normal life might just be worth the extra $60 a month my insurance doesn't cover on the Ritalin LA.",10,28,1

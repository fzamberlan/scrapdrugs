I'm only on 18mg (Extended release) and take it with Wellbutrin (for the depression) and I must say it's a life changer! (The X release makes a big difference - blood levels are more stable) No more emotional moods, no more crying, no more feeling like dying, no more negative thoughts. Also, you can concentrate for long periods of time and not get frustrated and be very clear minded. I can study for 6 hours straight! After trying so many medications, this just works.  Side effects: Fast heart beat, LOTS of energy and maybe a libido boost. Really good for adult ADHD and Depression.  Please note. Everyone is different. You might have a different experience.",0,5,1

"Methylphenidate","Sunny","March 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","<b>Concerta (methylphenidate):</b>			 It took a while to get used to but I weigh about 160 lb. and take 54mg daily now. Overall, it just makes it so much easier to be focussed and organized, with the meds I can actually keep routines. Biggest side effect for me is the appetite loss, I lost 30 lb within the 1st 6 months. Thankfully, that has lessened a lot and I’ve gained some of the weight back but definitely something to consider if you have concerns about being under weight or disordered eating. As well, if you try to have caffeine, nicotine, sativa, or any stimulants you’re going to feel like absolute garbage, so follow the doctors order and avoid them. Only other warning you might not find online is that the brand name Concerta is expensive and not always covered (in BC, Canada). It wasn’t covered by my university health plan but it’s covered by my work plan with blue cross. For 90 tablets of 54mg Concerta (brand name, my doctor told me not to take the generic) it costs 400$.",0,9,1

He will still express that he doesn't feel tired and that he doesn't want to go to bed but when we tell him that he needs to he just goes to his bed without the fighting or trying to do anything else to stop from going to bed.  He is more loving and affectionate now whereas before he was always so defiant. He does cry a bit easier now but it's better than the anger he felt before. He's helpful and considerate and empathetic. We reluctantly gave him this drug and it has saved my marriage and our overall quality of life has improved drastically.

I thought that everybody has a unique behaviour and mind and so this unusual type is mine and I should control it by myself! From childhood I was the kid who study hard but gained little, who is forgetful, who is weak in math! Who is lazy. Anyway, now I'm medical student and I found that I have ADD after a long story.  I told this to my attending physician and he confirmed that I have ADD, then prescribed ritalin 10mg per day and increased that to the dose 10mg ×3 a day. The best word I can tell you about Ritalin for ADD patients is Miracle. Now for the first time in my life I understand the meaning of being calm, being happy, being focused, being organized and many other good 'Being's'.

I take the 54 mg dose.  I've tried probably every antidepressant there is, and quite a few for anxiety. But this I think personally Concerta has helped quite a bit in regards to both. Because of it I've been able to wean off my antidepressant and no longer have to take it. The appetite suppressant does help me out since I'm working on weight loss, but it can also be a struggle to eat at times or find a food that is appetizing in general because of it. And the medication can cause constipation and dry mouth, which is inconvenient. Overall, I think it's helped me a lot in focusing on course work and it's intended purpose.",0,10,1

Then I took 20mg, I felt a little more energized but nothing else. Then I tried 30mg today. I felt extremely fresh in my mind, instead of the weird slump I'm usually in. Very happy, which suggests that what I lacked before was dopamine. Still no difference with anything else, like my poor concentration and focus, but on the other side there is no side effects as of late. Other than the things, that I've already struggle with, like depression and anxiety. Not a bad experience thus far, but I'm still a little bit nervous, about how 40mg and 50mg will affect me.",0,7,1

But once I am studying, I can focus. So it does help. But I have zero side affects. The reason I liked Ritalin LA is because I never felt hunger, and the focus was awesome.

I've been on Ritalin for seven months and it has absolutely changed my life. Not only can I concentrate better, but the anxiety and depression are both improved too. I am so grateful to have this medication. I should have figured this out years ago. I don't feel stimulated or up at all, in fact it makes me relaxed. Don't hesitate. Great medication.

I might go back to Vyvanse - but it did have weird side effects by about 6:30pm every evening.

The first month after being diagnosed with ADD I was on Ritalin, then switched over to Concerta. I’m on the 72 mg of Concerta and it really has changed my life. I failed two classes in college before I started medication, and now I am doing really well in school. It really helps me focus in general as well. I’ve lost 70 pounds since I started taking medicine for my ADD, so I’m currently 140. This medicine destroys my appetite until it wears off. So I usually only eat at night. It also has messed with my sleep, so I make sure to take it by 9 in the morning so that it will wear off by like 10 at night. Whenever the medicine wears off I become super unproductive, but I’m not sure if that’s how I am without it or if it’s just worse when the medicine wears off. I really recommend Concerta, it really has helped me so much",0,26,4

I've been trying to find the right stimulant with bearable side effects since I was in high school. Please excuse the lengthy review I just know the search can be tough and long. I have Depression, ADD, GA &amp; SA, and OCD skin(cuticle) picking tendencies. It's been very hard finding a stimulant that didn't worsen my anxiety related symptoms. I could tolerate 5mg adderrall XR but my body burned through both the XR and IR in about 3 hours. Then I would crash for the rest of the day (depressed, irritable, anxious).  Vyvanse gave me zero motivation and made me calm but in a weird way. For example, I didn't care or worry about anything... I didn't even want to talk to people. I would just want to sit there alone and stare at a wall or something. It was nice to be that relax but too weird. But the real problem was the crash! It was the most extreme of all the stimulants I've tried by far! I took it only twice and threw it out. I almost didn't try Daytrana patch because Ritalin was actually the first stimulant I tried, which was over 10 years ago and I remember similar symptoms to that I had on adderrall. I ended up giving it a try with the logic that it might be smoother since its was for children and I was also desperate since I'm working and study for the GRE. I'm so happy I gave Daytrana a shot!! I'm telling you if you suffer from anxiety, can't tolerate the crashes, and metabolize the other stimulant too fast you have got to try this one!! I've only been on it for a week but I can't believe it! I leave it in for the whole 9 hours and I never crash. In comparison to Adderall is still the best stimulant for getting you motivated, I have to motivate myself a little but unlike adderall I can stay focused ALL day with Daytrana. Im also less likely to do something stimulanty like start reorganizing my closet for no reason but I do get the necessary cleaning, errands, bills etc done effortlessly. And the best part is that it doubles as an anti-depressant since, what I assume is the increased dopamine stays in my system pretty much all day and night. The happiness doesn't feel like a high it feels more like an absence of depression. I don't have anymore of the repetitive negative thoughts. The constant emotions of hopelessness, guilt, embarrassment, you name it, just aren't there anymore. There is still a mild degree of sadness I carry with me but I have major depression so I feel like it's only normal and I can handle that :)!! As far as the negative side effects: Like all the stimulants I've been on I still have the insomnia, loss of appetite, and increase urge to pick at my cuticles at night when it's wearing off. But there is not a crash. no evenings being completely drained of energy, fits of irritation, major anxiety or depression.  Also, the patch is applied to your hip and I'm experiencing some muscle tension in my legs which I think might be slowly subsiding. Im drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins in precaution of cramps.  Advice on taking the patch off- It's easier for me to take it off when it's wet.

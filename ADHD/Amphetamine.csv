"Amphetamine","Honey88","January 9, 2020","-","<b>Dyanavel XR (amphetamine):</b>			 As an adult with ADHD, I love this medication because it allows me to adjust the dosage as needed. I don't take my medication on weekends and on holidays. So when I get back on my meds for work, I can start out with a lower dosage rather than shocking my system with my regular high dosage. It's the best medication overall in terms of allowing me to concentrate and not making me into a zombie, allowing me to eat even with a decreased appetite, and not making me an insomniac.  However, this medication is WAY too expensive. The new manufacturer's coupon is pitiful, covering only up to a max of $140 when the medication itself is +$400. Previously, I was only paying $20/mo for my prescription the coupon. Of course, my insurance co wants me to use other (cheaper) drugs that I've tried, but don't work for me in terms of helping me concentrate and/or the side effects are too strong. Insurance companies need to stop trying to play doctor and give patients the medications that they NEED.",0,4,1

"Amphetamine","Steve","December 1, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine):</b>			 I was taking Adderall IR 20 MG 2x daily from 2005 to 2019. I moved to a new state and had issues filling my old prescriptions until I found my new doctor, so I ran out and was unmedicated for about 2 weeks. I planned on continuing Adderall, but the doctor recommended that I try Adzenys. I can understand the people who switch from Adderall with no time in between saying that they feel nothing because Adzenys isn't such a jolting medicine, and that's what I like about it. You retain your personality, things don't irritate you, and you are able to concentrate. I started with 6 MG and it didn't last long enough (4 hours). The next month was 12 MG, still not long enough. My third month was 15.7 MG, and works from 8 AM - 5 PM. Unfortunately my 4th month of 15.7 mg I suddenly feel like it's not as effective (like I took the 12 MG). I'm going to increase to the next dosage level, and hopefully it continues having the same effect as it used to. Definitely much easier on your body than Adderall.",0,4,1

"Amphetamine","SymptomSavant","October 31, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Evekeo (amphetamine):</b>			 For my limited purposes, Evekeo has worked great. I use it as a booster dose late in the day. The difference between this med and Adderall is that Evekeo is 50/50 d- and l-amphetamine, whereas Adderall is 75% d/25% l. Theoretically, that change to 50/50 should decrease the  high  dopamine feeling mg-for-mg and increase norepinephrine release which could increase cardiovascular side effects. But for me, I only take 10 mg, so it’s like a cup of coffee with better focus late in the day. At higher doses, maybe Adderall would be better, but as a booster, I find Evekeo to be effective and free of any significant side effects.",0,2,1

"Amphetamine","Emily","August 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine):</b>			 I've had ADHD since childhood. When I got to high school it became unmanageable. I went on low dose adderrall. When I turned 18 I stopped going to the doctor. When I started working my ADHD disrupted my work, so I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed adzenys. Another reviewer described it as an other worldly feeling which sounds about right. After about 6 months on the medication I fell into a psychotic episode. I was taken off adzenys. The psychosis subsided after a couple of days. It was determined that the psychosis was a side effect of adzenys and not a symptom of a mental health condition. Now I'm not allowed to take any amphetamine medications (besides strattera which doesnt work). Adderrall worked for me for years with no side effects, but it just so happened that my new psychiatrist prescribed adzenys as ADHD medicine for all patients. This medication ruined my treatment of ADHD for life and has given me a poor prognosis for the future.",0,3,1

I'm not a fan of taking meds in the first place so this was a problem for me. My doc made the switch to Evekeo 10mg once a day but advised me to taper myself until I felt it working. I'm in healthcare so no problem tapering and keeping track. Being that it was new to me I started by taking 2.5mg and tapering up over the span of several days. I didn't feel a single thing all the way up to when I finally tapered to 20mg all at once. The only things I think I felt from it was paranoia/anxiety (that seemed to come out of nowhere) and craving beer... I hate beer! During this trial my productivity and focus tanked.

Vyvanse lasted way too long, had a fight or flight feeling in my chest nonstop, and then made me depressed when it wore off which lasted a while. Adderall was too short and I didn't like crashing twice a day (2 pills). Adzenys XR-ODT is a good middle. Still crashes, still appetite suppression, but it is smoother and doesn't last 20 hrs like vyvanse. Only issue I have with it is it is extremely hard to locate and I have had to drive 40 minutes to a pharmacy to get it on occasion. It also comes in a large inconvenient box, instead of a pill bottle. Biggest struggle with ADHD medications is while they help me focus, they do not help me choose my focus.

First, this drug can be extremely hard to locate, and if a pharmacy doesn't have it, it tends to take a while to get it in.  Secondly, it has caused severe insomnia. I see some other people have had that subside within a few weeks but I've had it for practically the entire time. Lastly, its ability to help me maintain drive and focus is too infrequent.

Because of our schedule, he takes it around 5am every day but it seems to wear off by noon. He's still moody but I have trouble making out if his moods are from the meds, puberty, the fact that his dad just left for a year deployment, or a mix of it all.

I HATE to swallow pills and didn't want to carry around any syrup with me so this works perfect for me.  Actually taste like orange! Which as you know most drugs don't actually taste like the flavor they say it should so I was pleasantly surprised.  I got to try it out free for the first month and will be continuing to use in the future!",0,10,4
"Amphetamine","!Charm_87!","July 23, 2016","-","<b>Adzenys XR-ODT (amphetamine):</b>			 I'm on day 2 of adzenys. I like that I take it once.  But the texture is gritty once dissolved. It's a dissolvable pill so what do you expect? I do experience dry mouth and slight decrease in appetite but it's nothing serious. My doctor started me on a pediatric dose of 6.3 milligrams once a day. Another problem I see is that I'm having a hard time falling asleep. It could be because I take the medication around 11 o'clock in the morning but that's the time I get up. So it's honestly too early for me to tell.we will see once I get a routine going and school starts again.",0,14,4

I feel like a reborn person detoxed of alcohol and all meds replaced it all with Dexies and WOW I am alive! It took me 4 months to get used to them. They are a real pain in the neck to take every 2 hours. In 1st 4 months it was hell, I became so incredibily depressed, wanted to jump off a bridge. Interval was too big. 4-5 hours.  I pushed it to 40 mg a day every 2 hours. He said You won't sleep if you take them after 5 pm. I sometimes take them at 9 pm and sleep at 11 pm. Sideffect: big ass headaches if I dare to forget my pill after 2 hours.",10,0,4

However, I frequently had issues remembering to take it in the mornings and would often forget to take my medicine. Adzenys XR-ODT is so convenient in the blister pack I remember to take it, and the orange flavor is great! It lasts all day andI don't get a bad crash at the end of the day like I used to with my Adderall XR. Also, got first month free and pay only $25 per month with co-pay card",0,16,5

"Amphetamine","Moke","December 9, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Evekeo (amphetamine):</b>			 Evekeo works great. It's more mild in regards to excitability in comparison to adderall.  Evekeo is Amphetamine Sulfate and carries 50% dextroamphetamine and 50% levoamphetamine.  Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, so Evekeo is much smoother and wears off slowly vs adderall's fluctuating tapering.  It is much different than adderall.  Evekeo doesn't make you feel wired like adderall does.  It's a cleaner medicine.  Evekeo is a freebase Amphetamine while adderall has 4 different salts.  I would recommend the makers of Evekeo to make higher milligram tablets.  It's similar to a 10mg adderall IR.  It's just the ratio of ingredients that's the difference. Duration is said by pharmacists to be 12 hr's, buts more like 6.",0,41,5

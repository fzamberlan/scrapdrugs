"Aptensio XR","Animal Girl","April 16, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I started on Concerta and take 60mg because I developed a tolerance to it. That was back in high school. Now I am in college and take Aptensio XR. Aptensio lasts all day for me and it makes a lot easier to focus. I love not having to take two pills a day like I had to in high school.",9,0,1
"Aptensio XR","Leelee","September 14, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","My 6 yo takes 15 mg of Aptensio and I give it to him around 8:15 am. By the time he gets home at 4pm the rebound effect is rough.  I am wondering does he need 20 mg to get him through his day?  Usually around 1:30 to 2 pm he’s is completely done with school and has a hard time focusing.",7,0,1
"Aptensio XR","Brooke","May 7, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My son has very severe ADHD. He is 11&amp; 1/2 years old.  He is in 6th grade and extremely intelligent. He was diagnosed with ADHD several years prior. My husband refused to accept that our son had ADHD &amp; absolutely refused to let our pediatrician put him on meds. I was losing my child. The ADHD was so severe he began failing in ALL aspects of life AND school. He became unable to function. My husband finally realized that our son was in serious jeopardy. After researching, we found his current pediatrician who immediately took action. He started him on Aptensio XR. It was a night and day miracle. Within 2 days my son was back. There were 2 weeks left of the 3rd quarter of school before report cards. My son flew into action and worked so hard to get all of his failing grades up to passing in the 2 weeks. He did it. Now we are halfway through the 4th quarter and he has straight As.  His dosage has been titrated up to 40mg. This medication really works for him.",9,8,1

"Aptensio XR","female 11 years old","May 19, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My daughter has been taking Aptensio for 3 months now. She takes 50mg once a day. She has taken just about every drug on the market. The longest lasting about 8 months. She takes the Aptensio at 7am and by 3:00 when she comes home she is a total train wreck! The come down for her is fast and has her acting worse than before medicated. She says she isn't really finding her focus to be much better when at school. However, in the past 3 months she has put on 5 lbs. She is always hungry which is a total change from any other stimulant med she has tried. I take the same med and have put on 13lbs. in three months. We know of two other children that have gained as well and love the med. So if your child is under weight from stimulants try this one",5,7,1
"Aptensio XR","Female 45 years old","May 19, 2017","-","I have been taking Aptensio now for 3 months. I have been diagnosed with ADHD now for about 2 1/2 years. I have taken just about every non stimulant and stimulant on the market.  I am currently taking 50mg of the Aptensio  once a day. I am finding myself still scattered brained and my memory is horrible. I think the pill is lasting about 6 hrs and then I have a hard come down making me a total witch! The one thing that I have noticed is that I have put 12 lbs. on in 3 months. I am constantly eating! I had my thyroid checked and it came back normal.  I have spoke with other people that say they are gaining weight on the pill as well.",5,4,1
"Aptensio XR","Kittiebunnie","March 7, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I am 37 years old and was finally diagnosed with Adult ADHD almost 2 years ago so I was put on 20 mg Adderal XR and it worked great. But I did start to notice that I would get pretty irritable on it mostly when it was wearing off. So I wanted to try a different medication to see if there was one I wasn't so grumpy on. So I started Metadate CD and I was not irritable on that one at all :) But it seemed to wear off within 4 hours and made me soo tired. So now I am on Aptensio and it has been pretty good so far I have only been on it for about a week and it really does last a long time and I am able to stay focused. I don't feel a crash like Adderal. I would just recommend taking it early in the morning so it can wear off before you go to bed.",9,7,1
"Aptensio XR","KatieAMos","February 1, 2017","-","My 9 year old has been on 40mg for almost 6 months now. It worked great for the first 4 months, then its effectiveness wore off. He developed a TIC about a month and a half ago, and then a month ago he started getting very moody. Its just gotten worse as the time goes on. This is frustrating because we have tried a bunch of medicines and 2 have worked but it seems after 6 months the side effects hit full force.",5,7,1
"Aptensio XR","Edzo1977","October 1, 2016","-","My son went from Vyvanse 50mg in am and 20mg in afternoon over to Aptensio 50mg once a day. So far so good and he doesn't need to take a med in school which he likes.  It seems to last into early evening if we give it at 7am.",8,7,1
"Aptensio XR","JennBMS","July 14, 2016","-","For three years we have tried so many meds to control my daughter's ADHD. None worked or it would work for a month and stop. This was our miracle drug. She had no side affects. It's been a long three years and we finally have normalcy in our lives. It's a 12 hours release as well, unlike the others at 8 hours.",9,18,1

"Desoxyn","Phamphoe","December 15, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been on every derivative and variation of stimulant, SSNRis SSRI, Tricyclics, beta blockers and all sorts of combinations of above and never have come across such an amazing compound. as Desoxyn.  I think that there is a definable difference in mood thoughts and the way thoughts flow with memory and with present day crises.  I have come to a conclusion that the L1-L4 dopamine transporter in the brain through synergistic medicine can be accomplished by open mindedness and breaking down the  social norm  and trying outside the box treatments.  What if we are letting our deficiencies allow misdiagnosis,  how will one ever get better.  You wouldn’t deny an ex heroine addict methadone or suboxone.  Why does a former addict not get offered the best treatment.? Not the best checked box.",10,22,1
"Desoxyn","Tanko","November 4, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","First, I’m a male in his 30’s I weigh 195lb and am 5’8.  Currently I’m on 5mg of Desoxyn. I feel a little foggy today but for the first time I’d say in my life I woke up the first time the alarm went off at 5:30 and stayed up. If you don’t feel good on adderall then get off of it. I felt even more panicked on that drug and my doctor and parents said no it’s ok. Listen to your body. I’m co morbid with depression and ADD. I was scared to take meth because honestly  well  it is METH. But from what I read it crosses your blood brain barrier better because the methyl group is lipid soluble. Unlike others that feels like it’s wringing your head out like a dish rag this is like a giant soaked sponge that is just squeezed lightly. I have good insurance through the federal and I only pay $10 for 30 pills. If you have mental health problems and need meds go to the VA or the post office for work for the best insurance.",10,21,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","May 18, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I have tried Cylert, Adderall, Ritalin &amp; Desoxyn. I found Desoxyn to be the best treatment of ADD (as well as Depression &amp; an Eating Disorder) by far... I may be an anomaly, but I have taken Desoxyn for 25 years without any adverse effects. With Desoxyn I was able to focus on higher education, professional success, etc",10,49,1
"Desoxyn","Anders","March 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","After being prescribed nearly every type of stimulant/ADD medication available, I finally found a doctor who was open minded enough to prescribe Desoxyn for both ADD and treatment resistant Depression. The problem with Ritalin, Adderall,  Dexedrine is that for a necessary therapeutic dose to be reached, the Peripheral Nervous System is triggered, bringing about all those pesky side effects like nervousness/jitteriness, racing heart, ANXIETY/panic attacks were a HUGE problem for me, insomnia and loss of appetite However, a low dose of Desoxyn (10mg) gives me 100%  of the positive effects from, say, 60mg Adderall,  with maybe 10% of the  undesired side effects. It simply is a much more comfortable experience than any other ADD med I’ve ever taken. Hands down.",9,55,1
"Desoxyn","JustAnotherPatient","January 14, 2019","-","With this review, I want to cover two things: 1. Effectiveness of the medication itself First, I have to say, after dealing with depression and ADD for most of my life, and having tried literally every conventional anti-depressant and ADD medication, I can honestly and without hesitation say that Desoxyn is the absolute best medication I've ever used to treat my ADD. Ritalin worked for a brief period of time, then the side effects would dominate the efficacy with concentration. I generally felt like I had consumed too much coffee when I took Ritalin. Dexedrine made me feel hyper and edgy. Adderall was even worse, with Peripheral Nervous System stimulation that made my body sweat, my mind dart back and forth, and my stomach turn in knots. It was a miserable experience. I wanted something different. I met with a new provider, who was very open minded when it came to medication and alternative therapies.....",9,41,1
"Desoxyn","oldkaw","January 15, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Adderall was originally called Obetrol  before Shire reincarnated it years later. Obetrol was a mix of dextro/levo amphetamine/methamphetamine. The best tool you could have in your tool box to treat ADD would be 10mg of Adderall combined with 20mg of Desoxyn BID or TID. Please speak with your physician.",10,39,1
"Desoxyn","MPGOH","December 12, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have tried Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin, and other formulations... all of which had issues. Adderall was the worst, or most notable at least, due to the extreme anger, frustration, tendency towards violence, physical tension, and horrible comedowns. I cannot tolerate more than 20-30mg of this medication, period. Ritalin on the other hand, was very good for some tasks like school work, and math problems. However, it dulled my emotions and made me feel less... like me?  Desoxyn feels smooth, positive, and had the least negative physical side-effects. The focus was not as intense as other Amphetamines, but I felt that it allowed me to have more control over my emotions than any other ADHD medication... while feeling sober.",10,47,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","March 7, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","How is this not more widely prescribed? My doc had me on Strattera at first, didn't help at all. Next I switched to Concerta, which worked, but  increased my anxiety, and I had a crash. Next I switched to Adderall, which had almost the same effect as Concerta but on top of that I had no appetite. Finally I switched to Desoxyn and that's when my life started to turn around. My grades instantly went up and homework became fun for me. Math problems became like a puzzle, and history became fun, like watching a real-life movie. Right when I made the switch to Desoxyn, I got caught up on ALL my homework and my grades instantly switched from D's and F's to B's and A's. Not only that, but my social anxiety was completely GONE.",10,89,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","November 17, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been on this drug for 12 years and it greatly improved the quality of my life in a lot of ways . the problem I am having now is that I still have some organization skills not because of the  medication. I was getting my mental health needs thru park nicollet health care . now i can not find mental health care that are willing to prescribe this medication that helped me immensely.the problem with the drug is its unpopularity of the drug from providers because of the abuse of street methamphetamine. those providers do not have the knowledge of the things that they are supposed to when it comes to aadd",10,59,1
"Desoxyn","Bostonholly","November 5, 2016","-","I've used all the first line ADHD meds beg. in 2003 and only 1 was effective but of course my tolerance is depleted  it's not so effective now: Adderall generic 30XRAM,0 regular PM. Yet, without it I'm like a hyperactive confused kid again. I don't want a higher dosage.I want a change-  I asked my older,psychiatrist (been with him since late1980's ) about Desoxyn  which he said I've  never heard of it.  He's 100% Psychopharm. treats kids thru seniors;  MA trained MD, Harvard+ BU Med School,is it possible that MA laws never permitted this medication tb used 4 ADHD ? Should I ask again or  won't find it in MA pharmacies?  Don't want to sound like a druggie either but it's frustrating to be stymied. At my age,62.5, I'd like some relief again",0,41,1
"Desoxyn","fullthrottlediv","January 14, 2016","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This drug has the highest rating because it works the best.  It is a shame that the insurance companies have such a hard time giving people the drugs that work.  I have such issues with the other drugs that treat my ADHD that I have stopped taking any because the insurance company wont pay for desoxyn.  Shame on them!",10,77,1
"Desoxyn","bzbee201","December 18, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been taking desoxyn for 6 yrs now for ADHD and TRD (treatment resistant depression). Before this I had been mostly bed bound for nearly twenty years due to severe depression until I switched pdocs.  I am SO glad I did! Now when I wake up in the morning I have hope, and now I am actually happy to be alive.  Long ago I tried ritalin, but had only bad effects.  I'm no longer a burden to my family! The day I started it was like a switch turned on and life turned around. I graduate from college soon and even have a fiance and friends. Unbelievable! I tried so many things (inc ECT) before this drug and can't understand why this wasn't tried FIRST? If you have been suffering like me beg your doctor for this.  I hope this helps someone.",10,136,1
"Desoxyn","mark657","November 17, 2015","-","10/10 miracle for my ADD, fog/fatigue, OCD. Can now take things 1 at a time. No more racing thoughts! Minimal side effects. Thank you for helping!!!",10,82,1
"Desoxyn","brave0ne","November 9, 2015","-","The medical establishment should be ashamed! I have struggled all my life with side effects from the 'acceptable' ADD medications.  They gave me anxiety and a crash that made me irritable to boot! I have none of those side effects now and people have noticed a very positive change in me.  I am much more successful at my job, my anxiety is much lower, and my wife has noticed my nightly irritability is completely gone. I now feel like a complete person! Why wasn't I prescribed this first? How much of my life have I lost? What could I have accomplished? I'm glad I didn't know this was actually methamphetamine when I was prescribed it or I would have said NO WAY. How the media portrays it and the actual effects on me are miles apart.",10,129,1
"Desoxyn","Stoweo777","September 30, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Hopefully I ve found Desoxyn and my Doctor started directly with high doses of 70 mg a day, my ADHD is totally gone, no more depression, I totally stopped smoking, I can have sex again, no more stress, no more turning around and around in a room, no more shaking my legs all day long, I can finally concentrate on  a task that I enjoy, I'm able to finally organise my  life, I clean my flat and I can work, no more brain hyperactivity. I've  also  tried before Ritalin, Dexedrine, Aderrall and Vyvanse, none helped me  my ADHD disorder.  Finally I know actually that I can live a happy Life, thats possible with DESOXYN70MG/DAY",10,109,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","July 9, 2015","Taken for 10 years or more","Been taking this more than half my life, I've tried literally everything for ADHD and Chronic SEVERE Major Depression Disorder, you name it, I've tried all the ADHD meds and antidepressants available in Northern America, none work except for Desoxyn. Once I started Desoxyn and settled on a dose that worked for me, I haven't had to increase my dosage in ALL of my years of taking it, furthermore, I have absolutely NO side effects. An absolutely huge contrast to lesser amphetamines like dextroamphetamine etc, all of which produced nothing but negative side effects, and constantly would require dose increases to make up for their inefficacy, which just increased my side effects. So when I was young I asked my psychiatrists to RX it to me. 10/10",10,99,1
"Desoxyn","WingedReviewer","October 21, 2014","-","This medication is by FAR the most effective one I have ever tried to relieve my ADD/ADHD/Narcolepsy/&amp; Obesity issues.  This medicine certainly causes less anxiety than phentermine AND other amphetamines.  Sadly, people are ignorant and choose to attack a very safe and effective medicine that probably saves many lives. Desoxyn is the only sure-fire medicine to aid in treating attention deficit and fatigue!  At doses of 30mg-60mg a day, the medication is effective.  Don't think that 1- tablet is going to help - the effective CLINICAL dose is in the 20mg range-70mg.",10,99,1
"Desoxyn","krbsshguy","August 16, 2013","-","Ask your doctor to prescribe you Desoxyn. It will change your life. I have had ADHD since I was 14. I am now 36 and I have tried almost all of the medications allowed to try for ADHD and found that Desoxyn had the least side effects of any of them. I know they have to list lots of side effects, however Desoxyn helped me concentrate, made me feel like I was ready for whatever the day was going to throw at me.  This medication is a lifesaver and a miracle. It had less side effects than the other ADHD medications.",10,130,1
"Desoxyn","me2buc","November 15, 2012","Taken for 2 to 5 years","If you have to take a stimulant and you get anxiety, this is the medication to take. It is very smooth and doesn't cause anxiety. There isn't a high and low and you don't really feel this wear off (no ups and downs) the way that Adderall and other medicines cause a low in the evening. This is not any more addicting than any other drug so don't believe that. People that require these types of medication typically don't get addicted to them.  People and doctors tend to give medications that can help people.",10,128,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","September 12, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I feel like I can breathe!  This is the only medicine that resolves my ADD symptoms. I have tried everything else and they just can't compare. Totally makes it so I have the courage to live again, to walk up to people I don't know and talk to them, to feel less depressed, to stand up for myself, and above all to focus on the important things. I wish more doctors were informed of how helpful it really is to people who have adult ADD.",10,133,1
"Desoxyn","lumenz","June 18, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","MUCH BETTER than Adderall, Vyvanse, or Dexedrine, or Ritalin.  IT is more effective for performing my scores on tests and learning.  It is better for the social anxiety component of ADHD. It is neurotoxic so you may not want to stay on it for the entire year, however, IT DOES have medical value at low doses if used by RESPONSIBLE users for several months out of the year. IT IS very effective for controlling treatment resistant depression and appetite problems as well. However, appetite would return to baseline when stopping Desoxyn.  I think this medicine should be strictly controlled, but should be available to patients who could truly benefit from it.  It has helped me get through a very difficult year, but my doctor took me off it.",10,95,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","December 6, 2011","-","Works very good as a stimulant in the treatment. It also helps in calming the brain. Storm of thoughts without the hyperfocus that other stimulants seem to bring on.",7,88,1
"Desoxyn","Fattyjack","November 17, 2009","-","Desoxyn has opened doors to my life, heart, and mind that I thought would never be able to be opened and be shared with the world.  The side effects were little to none and other medicines side effects greatly outweighed the Desoxyn effects.",10,93,1
"Desoxyn","Rx2009","October 27, 2009","-","I took the tablets after being on all forms of Dexedrine, Ritalin, Adderral, etc. It had no side effects, but was not as big a deal as it is made out to be. Dextroamphetamine spansules (brand SKF) are far more effective and long-lasting for ADHD, which I've dealt with.",7,56,1
"Desoxyn","Paravis","June 24, 2009","-","After trying Strattera, Vyvanse, Adderall and Dexedrine with side-effects that interfered with my daily life, I was prescribed Desoxyn.  A smaller dose of Desoxyn gives a far greater primary effectiveness than any other medicine, and with significantly less side-effects than any other medicine.  As far as my ADHD is concerned, this medication is absolutely amazing at helping me out.",10,117,1
"Desoxyn","Anonymous","June 22, 2008","-","I would give it a 10 but will err towards conservative and give a 9; only because it has a high abuse potential and humans are inherently prone to some type of addiction.  It has pretty much NO side effects if taken as directed for adult add and after 5 years on it, I feel it has stabilized me more than any others.  Adderall is second place for me but it is more likely to make me irritable after therapeutic effects wane for the day.  I have taken Desoxyn before and fell asleep!",9,117,2

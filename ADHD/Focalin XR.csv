"Focalin XR","CollegeGirl","February 26, 2020","-","I am 19 year old female in college, and an athlete with extreme ADHD. I usually take Adderall Xr 20-30mg and it has helped me so much in college, I used to drink 6 cups of coffee a day just so I could focus enough to remember where I left my keys and sit down to take a test, but now adderall does that for me. FOCALIN however,  was possibly the worst experience of my life. Focalin took every bit of anxiety and sadness and threw me into several panic attacks. I am a very happy and energetic person, I have never experienced depression or anxiety like this. I didn’t sleep all night and I spent most of the night sobbing uncontrollably. My heart was beating out of my chest and I couldn’t think about anything but how sad and stressful everything was. I suggest to NEVER take this medication, the side effects FAR outweighed the purpose of the medication. I never felt focused or honed in.",1,3,1
"Focalin XR","MT","February 17, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I've tried almost every single ADHD pill from Adderall to Daytrana to Ritalin to Vyanese to Concerta...Focalin is BY FAR the best for me. I am on the 10mg dose. Was originally on 30mg but my heart was beating way too fast on it. The other meds made me very angry, but this keeps me at bay, yet focused. Only con I have with this is about an hour after I take it, I have a bowel movement. I'm also the same way with coffee. I don't take it everyday and on the days where I don't I can definitely tell, but I don't have cravings.",10,5,1
"Focalin XR","Frankl","January 11, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I was on  focalin XR when I was age 5 I think it is a good medication learning wise, but at the same time it drains you it takes your happiness and joy away it’s like you are completely numb to joy, when I’m off of it I can’t focus but I am always so joyous and happy, when I’m on it I focus perfectly but I am very zombied out and it is a horrible feeling",2,9,1
"Focalin XR","ashton","January 7, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Today was my first day on Focalin. I took 10 milligrams and it did absolutely nothing. I feel zero difference. The only difference I feel is the fact that I have a headache and sore throat.",1,3,1
"Focalin XR","Better life","November 15, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Our son was diagnosed with ADHD and Focalin XR has changed his life for the better.  He is able to focus at school now and he's performance, grades and happiness have all evolved.  It was with heavy hearts we finally relinquished using meds because of the fear of what it might do long term and seeing zombied-out kids who no longer have personalities.  Focalin didn't do this at all.  Our son is still very much himself but without the stress of struggling so hard to focus. It has changed our lives. Teachers, coaches and family have all noticed wonderful outcome.",10,20,1
"Focalin XR","Ev","October 16, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I’ve had ADHD for a very long time and didn’t start taking Focalin until (11th grade) I tried other stimulants in middle school but gave up because disliked the way they made me feel. Focalin does its job. It helps me focus and get work done, however, I do get shaky and anxious while on the drug. My appetite is also effected. You just have to decide if the side-effects are worth the outcome.",5,9,1
"Focalin XR","Anonymous","August 29, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've taken it on and off since I was in highschool (I'm 26 now). Generally 5-10mg has worked best for me. It helps me a lot when there are tasks I need extra focus on, and a lower dose can help in social situations. I found it to be helpful for school, and more recently at work. The worst side affect for me is a loss of appetite. I find that I have to totally guess how hungry I am and force it down so I don't get brain fog. It relieves anxiety in that I can finally do what I need to, but it raises anxiety in general. I try to take it as little as possible, and haven't experienced any issues taking it sporadically. Just keep the dose low.",8,11,1
"Focalin XR","Wouldn’t you like to know","August 23, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","The first day I took Focalin XR, it worked fantastic and I had so much energy and confidence was really feeling like myself again. 2nd day of taking it, it was ok wasn’t as good as the first day. Then the third day I felt no difference at all. Made me feel probably worse than when I was off of it. Was extremely exhausted had no effects at all. So I called my doc and he told me to start taking 2 (20mg each) and it did ok I felt the energy but literally no focus at all. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone may work ok for some but it’s a good chance it won’t.",1,3,1
"Focalin XR","AQ","August 15, 2019","-","Focalin does the trick in getting you less scatter-brained and it helps with focus, but be sure you are only ADHD and  aren't also autistic and/or have motor tics/nervous tics because it is an amphetamine stimulant drug. There it might make you more fidgety if you fidget or have nervous tics out of anxiety and over-stimulation. I'm on the spectrum and this drug makes my repetitive motor movements worse.",7,10,1
"Focalin XR","Max","July 28, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Long story short I was previously on Vyvanse 40mg a day, and I decided I wanted to try Focalin XR. Before that I was on Concerta and absolutely hated it, when I was a kid I apparently did very well on it, but not anymore. So I decided to give Focalin XR a try, and it works very well! The only 2 issues I have is the questionable quality of the release beads among certain generic manufacturer, and the severity of the crash.",7,5,1
"Focalin XR","Mo","July 22, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I’ve never commented on a drug before, but I feel compelled to here due the number of negative reviews. Focalin has completely given me a life... I went from not being able to function to a person who is optimistic, looks forward to taking on the day, carries out tasks to completion and enjoys doing so. It has given me the ability to be a much better man, husband and father. Will it do the same for you? Maybe... maybe not. But if it does, the result is priceless.",10,25,1
"Focalin XR","Johnsmith2359","July 13, 2019","-","Whenever I take this medication I feel bored of everything. I will just sit and do nothing instead of doing things I normally enjoy.

"Focalin XR","Lindsey","June 10, 2019","-","My 14 yr old son took Focalin for 2 yrs. He ended his own life while on this med. We were never told that suicidal ideation is a possible side effect. It is now recently listed as a side effect. I would have never given this to my child had I known. Children can not always express themselves and don’t connect dark feelings with a medication they are taking. Please be aware with children on these types of drugs! Heartbroken mom",0,60,1
"Focalin XR","Hi","May 19, 2019","-","My son with ADHD used to run around and be so loud and excited but now on the Fovalin XR he is calm quite and it feels like he is not here. He is in his room looking at the wall at the store he just sits in his seat silent and on the week end he lets me watch news and sleeps almost all the time and he is a total different person without it when I watch my TV he stares and don't care and he is horror without it",10,5,1

"Focalin XR","Jane Doe","April 26, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was prescribed this as my first treatment for ADHD when I was (finally) diagnosed at age 18. It helped me calm down a little, I could go to work and not feel the urgent need to go home. But then I would start crying at work, in public. I would cry to my parents until they couldn’t handle me anymore. The comedown from when it wears off was HORRIBLE for me. I have GAD, but the anxiety I experienced was nothing like that. It was acute fear and dread that came rushing in for the next 4-6 hours after the meds wore off. Also I should mention I lost feeling in my hands and feet. I tried taking it for about a month but it wasn’t worth it. Four years later I still haven’t found something that works.",2,6,1

I have been taking medications since I was in the first grade, and I can definitely tell the difference when I’m on this medication. I think my dose still needs to be messed with a little, but I feel a lot better. The only problem is that I’m losing a little bit of weight. Not a bad thing, but something to keep an eye on.",8,8,1
"Focalin XR","Rather Not Say","April 16, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I took this medicine it made me have suicidal thoughts. It is awful. It made me irritable and I could not get sleep.

"Focalin XR","CJ","April 4, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","These other comments are crazy and not relative to this drug vs others.  I have taken almost every type of ADD med and this is the best by far.  Methylphenidate has left and right branch isomers.  The right branch helps with ADD and the left branch causes stimulant jittery side effects.  Focalin/dexmethylphenidate is just the right branch.  Once you get your dosing right (I take 25mg XR in morning and 10mg IR in afternoon) then it is the best.  It is like a cure for ADD as opposed to taking a stimulant.  By far the lightest side effects.  It is less hard on the cardiovascular system than regular methylphenidate, and does not create neurotoxins like many of the amphetamine family drugs i.e. Adderall.  As long as you make yourself eat on it, then it is not noticeable.",10,25,1

At the the time of birth doctors told us he was born addicted to crack cocaine also might not learn or express himself in a standard way. Our son is now 8yrs old in third grade omega prodigy program. He started taking Focalin and guanfacine at 6yrs old helped tremendously. 2 months to start working over summer. It's not a miracle drug it just helps keep him focused. I have not seen any side affects and no we are not rich or private school boot camp people. We just have him read 45min a day and let him be a kid. Good luck",0,16,1

"Focalin XR","Cool Guy","August 16, 2018","-","I've always had ADD but didn't start trying to get help with it until I was about to start college. I tried Adderall for 2 weeks and became unable to eat and felt constantly awful. It was obvious Adderall wasn't working for me, so my doctor recommend Focalin XR, and I really can't recommend it enough. About a week after taking Focalin (10mg twice daily) I went from that to being able to work without distraction for at least 4 hours. I could focus on all the things I enjoyed for longer periods. I was no longer asking my friends and others I'm sorry could you repeat that? like I was before constantly. It has also helped me with my depression, I feel so much more motivated and I'm able to finally organize things without it feeling like a chore. Sadly it's quite expensive, unless you have very good insurance. My previous insurance covered it until I turned 19 at about $5, but with my current insurance it's $170/month with a discount coupon.",10,9,1

I just didn’t feel it working like it should. So my Dr. switched me to focalin xr 30mg. I read the starting dose is 10mg for adults, I guess since I took a higher dose of adderall my dr felt it was best to get me going on a higher dose of focalin. My job is working on the phones I have to call about 300 people a day. There is no way I would be able to perform my job well if I wasn’t taking this medication. I’m focused and not bored, I’m not day dreaming all day, I’m staying in my seat, I don’t have a messy desk. This stuff works.",10,12,1

"Focalin XR","Nunya beeswax","January 29, 2018","-","I was placed on this medication after taking a 5 question survey on a piece of paper.  That DOES NOT determine whether or not you have ADHD.  I was on this medication and lost 40 lbs.  I also lost several jobs, became very emotionally erratic, and nearly died after arriving to a hospital with a 260 BPM heartbeat.  After finding out that I have Mitral Valve Prolapse with regurgitation, I obviously was weened off this medication.  I ended up following up with a neurosurgeon completing a CAT scan from a previous Traumatic Brain Injury as a teen and then also completed neuro-psychological testing which proved that I, in fact, do NOT have ADHD even though I was diagnosed with it twice in my life.",1,8,2

He is so much happier that he is learning and can focus on one subject at a time rather than racing through his brain. I like it and only concerns is he can hold better conversations but his answers to question are very short How was your day? Good....You have to ask him more questions to get more answers. Then you have to repeat or either give him one instruction at a time for him to complete. I'm concerned about the long term side affects",8,19,2

Naturally, that also means that insurance companies don't want to cover it. If you're trying to get it covered and they're dragging their feet, don't give up! You have to jump through a lot of hoops and you have to fight every step of the way. Get your doctor to help you and talk to them. Do NOT give up.

I have talked to the doctors, had his ears checked and put on allergey medicines, he still digs in his ears. He does really well with the medicine in school and activities out side of school.

The meds have drastically improved their grades, behaviors and relationships.  Both boys take a small dose of Focalin with lunch to get through the afternoon and a small dose of Clonidine in the evening to slow things down for bedtime.  Focalin XR has been our saving grace - now instead of CONSTANT redirection, we can actually go do things and have fun.

I do think there are minor side-effects though.  It makes me feel much more focused and less worried/panicked about what I need to do.  Unlike other though I would not say it calms me down I feel like it actually stresses me out more.  When I take this I'm more serious and easily annoyed and I can't relax.  I have also found that my appetite drops off and that I don't sleep very deeply. Overall a great medicine but for me and many ADHD people our symptoms are brought out due to simply a lack of strenuous physical exercise (1hr) every day.  When on a regular exercise and sleep schedule I do not need it.",8,38,3

Two month later, it was discovered that I wasn't doing the daily logs, that everyone can do, but I couldn't do it easily. This behavior led to a Doctor and conclusion, I have ADHD. At first I was on Vyvanse 20 then 40, this left me speedy and jittery, almost unable to cope in public. So I changed to Concerta XR 36. Mild and cool enough, but I don't see the difference with my ADHD. So I moved to Focalin XR 25. It's been an hour since my taking it at 3pm. I feel it.",8,28,3

We have seen as many others have said that the medicine seems to wear off about the time they get home from school.  What we do is they have a small snack and take a small afternoon dose of 5 to 10 mg of regular Focalin to help them get to their homework and evening activities. If it is a no homework day or no activity day we opt to not take this medicine in the evening and we do not take the evening dose on the weekends. We do take the morning dose every day of the week.  We've not had any major side effects.  The only thing we have noticed is a slight decrease in my sons appetite not my daughters. We have also had to adjust medication as they have grown. But we have had wonderful success with both children on the medication.",9,108,3

I had behavior issues in my second grade class and I drove my teacher nuts with my constant distractions and my lack of focus. Little things like small talk and excessive noises triggered my symptoms and I was put on Ritalin LA when I was eight. Ritalin was awful for me. I didn't sleep very well at all. I had periods of insomnia and when I would sleep it was very prolonged in hours of sleep I was getting. Finally, after a couple of years suffering with this Ritalin I talked with my doctor about trying a new medicine called Focalin XR when I was 13 and I am almost 18 now.

Focalin XRs effect is much , much, much stronger than Concerta or Ritalin. This is very important to understand, so if you are thinking of switching to Focalin XR from another medication do not go to a similar strength. I was on Concerta 54mg and went to  Focalin XR 40mg. This was a scary experience I got dizzy almost passed out and couldn't tell you what 1 1 was. It was horrible  to say the least. I discontinued the Focalin and tried Adderal.

But I'm happy to report he's doing well in school and cooperating. I don't like that he seems so serious when he's on the medicine because I don't want a little robot.

While his appetite is down while on the medicine (about 7 hours), he eats a huge breakfast and a huge dinner to compensate.  Even his tick has gone away.   We are very relieved.

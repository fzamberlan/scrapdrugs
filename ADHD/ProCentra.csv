"ProCentra","Hbass120","March 22, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have taken this ProCentra as a booster with my Adderall XR and it's amazing and allows for it to work all day! Expensive and most doctors haven't heard of it but it is great and works",9,4,1
"ProCentra","Emmeali","November 17, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I am a 24 year old female diagnosed in my 20's with adult ADHD. I spent my entire childhood unable to focus on tasks, finish anything I started, behave and sit still in the classrooms. I scraped by barely with C's and D's in grade school. Eventually focusing became so hard to do with people around that I had my parents homeschool me. Fast forward to now, I am currently in my first semester of college, and I have a 4.0 GPA. This medicine works wonders. I normally cannot function at all. I am disorganized, and always have racing thoughts. On ProCentra I am calm, focused, and organized. I finish tasks, and manage my time better. I take 10mg. a day, oral solution. This medication is also covered on my insurance, with only a $10 co-pay. Love it!",10,27,1

"Modafinil","DannyDice","June 8, 2020","-","As a kid I was on Ritalin, without it I would have flunked. Once I reached my mid 20's the famed ADHD depression kicked in and I spent 10 years on anti-depressants. Work wise I grew out of my concentration problems, BUT it came back recently and I lost all focus. All I did at work was day dream for months. I code all day, and no this is not a magic pill to motivate you, you don't feel anything. Nothing at all..... BUT, I am sitting down at my desk and I'm typing. I still get distracted with the office chat and I don't get the unrelenting hyper focus others describe, but they helping. My mood is more level, dopamine is dopamine, my mood is neither up or down, or numb. I feel balanced but still like myself. I gave it 7 stars because my appetite vanishes and I get a dry mouth. When the effects subside I grow very hungry very quickly.",7,0,1
"Modafinil","Martin","May 14, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","For those whose insurance won’t cover Modafinil: Try its prodrug Adrafinil. It’s metabolized into Modafinil in the liver, way cheaper (like $30 a month), classified as a food supplement in the US and unregulated in most countries. I (m, 38) have used both, Modafinil and Adrafinil for my ADD non hyperactive with considerable success. They seem to be interchangeable, but given a choice, I would prefer Modafinil as for me it seems to act faster and puts less of a strain on the liver. I am able to function well on it and it helps me overcome my task initiation blocks. I can stick to a boring task and get it done. It also helps improve my mood. Correct dosage is really important and I did develop tolerance after prolonged use. Taking a break from it for a few days every now and then helped with that. What I don’t like is that it makes my urine smell weird.",9,2,1
"Modafinil","Ian","May 7, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I think it helped with staying awake, thought that might have been placebo. Didn't do anything for ADHD-related symptoms.",1,2,1
"Modafinil","Roro","April 6, 2020","-","For ADHD and narcolepsy. I took 300 MG a day for several months, hoping some improvement, but nothing, any difference. Even not side effects! Anything",2,0,1
"Modafinil","CJ","June 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I took this drug for a month and then stopped because I fell into my seasonal depression and needed some time to relax. Before this drug I took Adderall 30mg a day and eventually it wore me down and I was unwilling to take more. Modafinil came with virtually no negative side effects compared to Adderall. It feels like you are just at ease with whatever it is you want to be doing instead of trying to do things and feeling like you need to find your bed, It feels like the ultimate coffee. I recommend this drug as an alternative to Adderall any day of the week to anyone. It is much less neuro-toxic and has no side effects but yet gives me the mental clarity, focus, and stay up that I need to do what I want. Also people are saying this drug is expensive,I can get coupons and buy it for $35 in generic form. My insurance does want me to pay a lot though,",8,22,1
"Modafinil","JayR","May 9, 2019","-","My whole life I struggled to with focus, energy and confidence. It took great effort to pay attention and I struggled to complete things. Teachers, family and friends told me I was a daydreamer, an underachiever and lazy. I felt shame that I was not good enough and must just try harder. Then I was prescribed Modafinil at age 40 and was able to focus, had energy and social confidence. When visiting museums I was unable to focus on exhibitions for more than 2 minutes, I now spend a whole days museums reading everything! I've been discriminated for being forgetful, distracted and underachieving. Now I'm succeeding in a new career, communicate effectively and no longer feel shame. Unfortunately here in the U.K. doctors it is so hard to get a prescription. Shouldn't I have the right to a drug which makes me equal to my peers, able to reach my dreams and contribute to society. My greatest fear is access to obtaining it being blocked.",10,65,1
"Modafinil","BeeBee","April 1, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Since I am unmedicated for ADD, I've been trying several natural nootropics in the past. After reading about Modafinil, I've decided to give it a try. I mostly have problems with concentration and procrastination, and unfortunately, it doesn't work. I know that Modafinil is supposed to keep you awake and focused, but it doesn't help with motivation. Well, the thing is that it's not even keeping me awake. I've been experimenting with several doses, in various situations, I was taking care of not eating or drinking anything that interacts, but most of the time I can take a nap on it. And when it works, it makes me very anxious and irritable, so I can't take things done because of the anxiety. I gave it 5 stars, because some days it helps, kinda, but so far I'm not happy with the results. I think it works, but not for ADD.",5,12,1
"Modafinil","Melvin A","January 20, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I take a prodrug of modafinil called adrafnil but has similar effects, I feel energetic, productive, smart and speedy. This drug works wonders for depression and has made me feel euphoric. I recommend modafinil to anyone facing concentration and depression problems. I started a new job and have A's in school.",10,18,1
"Modafinil","1Texasbear","December 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I used Provigil for about 6 months  off label  for ADHD , non hyperactive type. I was trying to find something that wasn’t as strong as the Adderall (60mgs) twice daily. My Psychiatrist had me take one 30mg in the morning and a 100mg of Provigil at lunch time. This was generally when I took the second Adderall. The Adderall was immediate release. It seemed to work, but made me have headaches, neck and shoulder pain, and irritability. After 5 months on this regime I started noticing urinary retentiion. I finally got a UTI and had to go back to the Adderall! It’s a good medication for some people, but it wasn’t for me. Also it’s unbelievably expensive if you don’t have insurance that will pay for this medication, even the generic version.",4,10,1

"Modafinil","Ccr","September 17, 2018","-","Diagnosed PTSD depression and anxiety over 25 years ago. I've been on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds  but never felt even 75% better. Tried Modafinil - great.  Out of bed, no anxiety or very little.  Now doctor thinks I have ADD so was prescribed Adderall. I hate it.  I can't tell how well it's working because of having to cope with the anxiety and crashes it causes. Stopped Adderall and tried modafinil again and feel so much better. I don't know exactly what my condition is beyond PTSD.  But modafinil has been a life saver.  The cost which insurance won't cover Is too high and you do build up a tolerance to it.  You have to stop sometimes to clear your system. If I take a high does it doesnt work, or I feel terrible. I take only 50mg at a time-lasts about 4 hours right now..cuts the cost down Never had withdrawals just some sleepiness. Better Compared to other drugs and the horrible side effects and addiction potential.",9,12,1
"Modafinil","Catdad","August 25, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Wow is all I can say. I asked my doctor about Modafinil for my excessive daytime sleepiness and hypersomnia. She mentioned it also might be helpful for my ADHD. I am also prescribed Adzenys (amphetamine) which is great for the cognitive and emotional dysregulation aspects of ADHD, but Modafinil handles other symptoms: overwhelmed mood that results in low energy, anxiety around task initiation, and of course excessive daytime sleepiness. This should be approved for ADHD. And no crash when it wears off!",10,20,1
"Modafinil","Kt","April 23, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This is an untapped gem for people with ADHD. Yes I take it off label (particularly armodafinil) but it certainly works. Yes you might not feel as energetic as you do if you take adderall. But if you are looking for a change or just a break or every other week break from adderall to allow your poor brain and central nervous system some rest, this is for you.",9,16,1
"Modafinil","MiriArley","July 8, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I had been on Concerta in high school for questionable ADHD diagnosis, and it had a VERY minimal benefit. So minimal that after 2 school years it was determined my problem was probably more attributable to being smarter than your average bear and I just was not being challenged in my non-honours and non-dual credit classes.  Made it through Uni and my doctorate degrees OK by overloading my schedule and surviving on coffee and caffeine tabs, taking 18 hr semesters instead of the rec'd 12-15 hrs. Fast forward to a few yrs later, I have been on Adderall for about 4 mo, titrating to the perfect dose of 2×5mg at 8am &amp; 5mg at noon. Was switched to modafinil B/C my anorexia nervosa and I can't wake up, get out of bed, finish reading an email. Hate it!",1,10,1
"Modafinil","CarmenCL","July 6, 2017","-","I've severe ADD, in Romania ADHD was recognised for adults only a couple of years ago, Ritalin like meds aren't legal for adults, only Strattera and I need to take my parents to testify I'd had symptoms since my childhood - impossible. As I also used to fight not to fall asleep during the day, e.g. tramways, my family doctor wrote a prescription Modafinil 100mg -I  couldn't afford to buy more, it was ~E100, now ~E20. Tried one pill in my free days - had no real effect. Later I found a bigger dose had a great effect on my ADD. Dosage matters. Huge help for depression from not being able to handle your life &amp; for related pb. I'm 42 - quality of life &amp; being able to have things done matters more than some side effects (headaches used to be just at first)",9,14,1
"Modafinil","There is Hope","March 7, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medicine is literally a life changer. For so long I took adderall to get me through the day and to sustain focus during college courses. Adderall gave me severe anxiety and depression and I thought I had lost all hope seeing as that is the best drug for ADD... WRONG! Modafinil gives you the same level of focus without ANY side effects... no anxiety, no depression, no euphoria (which is great because adderall is very addictive) and minimal weight loss. It has improved my life to the point that my friends and family members have been commenting on how great I sound. I just wanted to share my experience (never have before, but I felt compelled to because this is an emotional topic for me) in case you're nervous about giving it a shot.",10,83,1
"Modafinil","kat kat","February 11, 2017","-","I started taking this for adhd when I realized that adderall wasn't cutting it anymore. Adderall works for about a year and then starts to become ineffective unless you keep upping your dose. After a year and a half I started searching for alternatives and came across this MIRACLE. It is not prescribed for adhd in the united states so insurance will not cover it for the most part. I have to order it overseas (it is technically illegal to do so in the US but customs only cares about abusive drugs). I really hope some researchers test armodafinil and modafinil for adhd and depression. It has done a lot for me. I highly recommend it.",10,51,1
"Modafinil","K...Wood","December 17, 2016","-","Excellent drug I have been taking it now 1.5 years.  Before  I was taking Adderall 30mg ER for  my Traumatic Brain Injury from auto accident 2007.   From the accident  I went into a coma and suffered head injuries to the Frontol Lobe.  Recently I stopped the Adderall and feel much calmer and happy without the side effects of Adderall. Now I am just taking Modafinal 200 mg. I gained about 8lbs in the first three weeks to a stable weight which is OK but my brain is much clearer. I'm fortunate I don't have to pay for Modafinal as I'm totally disabled and have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome due to Opioids. I have not been taking them for  25 years due to work related injuries from a Government Law Enforcement Job.  The CFS is opioid induced so my WC Doctor writes it for that..",10,19,1

Modafinil helps me to concentrate and focus without the side effects I've experienced with dexamphetamine, dexmethylphenidate and Ritalin® (methylphenidate). It also helps me with drowsiness and fatigue, caused by baclofen.  Although I am a former drug addict, I don't experience any addiction or dependence problems with modafinil. I'm from the Netherlands, where my  insurance covers the above medications fully.",9,35,1

"Modafinil","Superbuddha","August 13, 2016","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I started using Adderall in College to help me balance my workload and social life, but I switched to Modafinil after hearing all the bad press about Adderall as very similar to meth and found many of my superiors in the company I was working for to be using Modafinil for performance enhancement. Modafinil has provided the focus and energy that Adderall provides but without the side effects. Highly recommended",10,34,1

I have always had problems being tired all the time and that helped along with the other sytoms. I have fallen asleep driving etc. I saw a neurologist his recommendation was a sleep specialist and take me off the adderall. My regular doctor weaned me off the adderall and started the modafinl. I started with 100 mg at the end off the adderall then went to 200 mg alone that done nothing she upped it to 400mg and it helped for a few months now it's like I'm taking a sugar pill it does nothing. I can not function or stay awake. Now going for sleep study.",7,25,1

Made me feel jittery, I felt all over the place couldn't concentrate actually. Also made me feel unsocial and bad mood. The only thing is yes you won't sleep.

Although I also tried Strattera for three months prior to my starting Provigil.  My only issue is that so far I have only been able to receive 200mg which only helps me until afternoon.  I am in need of a large enough prescription so I can have an afternoon dose.  Hopefully somehow my insurance can become convinced that this is necessary for my health.",8,57,2
"Modafinil","ChelleC","January 29, 2010","-","<b>Provigil (modafinil):</b>			 Provigil works great for energy, as well as ADD. I also suffer from Major Panic Disorder, and depression. This medicine gives me such a boost with no side effects, other then a little mood change late in the evening. I recently lost my health insurance due to my divorce, and could not afford it for 6 months, and what a difference I felt, no energy, and I slept more then ever. I think this medication is over priced, by all means, especially for people that it really works for and helps them though. The insurance company's need to cover this medicine, especially when it helps people with ADD and depression, and gives them energy that helps motivate them.",0,103,2
"Modafinil","Distracted","June 10, 2009","-","<b>Provigil (modafinil):</b>			 I've been using Provigil in combination with Wellbutrin for my adult ADD. I'm almost 50 and was just diagnosed 3 years ago. I tried the stimulants and like the way they helped my concentration and focus but I couldn't take them because of my high blood pressure. I've also tried Strattera which worked really well but again I couldn't deal with the side effects (not being able to urinate can be painful). Provigil really helps slow down my racing thoughts but it doesn't seem to help with my concentration or distract ability. I take it first thing in the morning and usually can't get to sleep until midnight or 1.00am. Luckily I work at home so that's not a real problem. I'm glad to see it's worked well for some of the others who have posted comments.",0,76,2

After 14 years of not being able to keep my thoughts together enough to hold a job, I can now connect the dots and have been working full time for a year and a half. I do not take Provigil to make me smarter or give me an edge. I just want to be able to balance my check book and hold a job. I no longer have insurance to help with the cost, so I have been trying to make what I have left last as long as possible. Lately I've been having trouble organizing my thoughts and being able to finish the simplest of chores. Looking back, it is amazing how much this drug helps me to live a normal life.",0,154,2
"Modafinil","Anonymous","January 27, 2009","-","<b>Provigil (modafinil):</b>			 I really love Provigil. I used it for ADD. Provigil helped me stay focused and motivated. The only side effect was if I took it to late in the day I might have a little trouble getting to sleep. It makes sense because it is a stimulant. It is a great drug for ADD because it doesn't cause all those nasty side effects other ADD drugs have. Unfortunately I have to stop using it because insurance won't cover Provigil because it has not been approved to be used as an ADD drug. Completely disappointing. It truly is an amazing drug for ADD.",0,113,2

"Methamphetamine","Phamphoe","December 15, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 I have been on every derivative and variation of stimulant, SSNRis SSRI, Tricyclics, beta blockers and all sorts of combinations of above and never have come across such an amazing compound. as Desoxyn.  I think that there is a definable difference in mood thoughts and the way thoughts flow with memory and with present day crises.  I have come to a conclusion that the L1-L4 dopamine transporter in the brain through synergistic medicine can be accomplished by open mindedness and breaking down the  social norm  and trying outside the box treatments.  What if we are letting our deficiencies allow misdiagnosis,  how will one ever get better.  You wouldn’t deny an ex heroine addict methadone or suboxone.  Why does a former addict not get offered the best treatment.? Not the best checked box.",0,22,1
"Methamphetamine","Tanko","November 4, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 First, I’m a male in his 30’s I weigh 195lb and am 5’8.  Currently I’m on 5mg of Desoxyn. I feel a little foggy today but for the first time I’d say in my life I woke up the first time the alarm went off at 5:30 and stayed up. If you don’t feel good on adderall then get off of it. I felt even more panicked on that drug and my doctor and parents said no it’s ok. Listen to your body. I’m co morbid with depression and ADD. I was scared to take meth because honestly  well  it is METH. But from what I read it crosses your blood brain barrier better because the methyl group is lipid soluble. Unlike others that feels like it’s wringing your head out like a dish rag this is like a giant soaked sponge that is just squeezed lightly. I have good insurance through the federal and I only pay $10 for 30 pills. If you have mental health problems and need meds go to the VA or the post office for work for the best insurance.",0,21,1
"Methamphetamine","Anonymous","May 18, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 I have tried Cylert, Adderall, Ritalin &amp; Desoxyn. I found Desoxyn to be the best treatment of ADD (as well as Depression &amp; an Eating Disorder) by far... I may be an anomaly, but I have taken Desoxyn for 25 years without any adverse effects. With Desoxyn I was able to focus on higher education, professional success, etc",0,49,1
"Methamphetamine","ADHddd...","April 30, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I am a male in my late 20s diagnosed  at a young age but never  pursued  pharmaceutical intervention as a treatment  until I was 17. Started with methylphenidate 108mg daily extended  release once stable, and then to adderall  IR 15mg twice daily because  of  negative  side  effects  like  headache, hyper focus, dehydration.  Even  though  I  tried  to  choke down  water and general  ill feeling  that I have  learned were attributed by the norepinephrine agonist properties. I started  Desoxyn at 23y years old and  it is notably smoother.  It  starts working faster  because of its increased potential to cross the blood  brain barrier  and it has a long lingering time active because  of the bodies extra difficulty metabolizing methamphetamine  vs amphetamine. Desoxyn works on dopamine  and serotonin   not  on the adrenergic  receptors.",10,6,1
"Methamphetamine","Anders","March 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 After being prescribed nearly every type of stimulant/ADD medication available, I finally found a doctor who was open minded enough to prescribe Desoxyn for both ADD and treatment resistant Depression. The problem with Ritalin, Adderall,  Dexedrine is that for a necessary therapeutic dose to be reached, the Peripheral Nervous System is triggered, bringing about all those pesky side effects like nervousness/jitteriness, racing heart, ANXIETY/panic attacks were a HUGE problem for me, insomnia and loss of appetite However, a low dose of Desoxyn (10mg) gives me 100%  of the positive effects from, say, 60mg Adderall,  with maybe 10% of the  undesired side effects. It simply is a much more comfortable experience than any other ADD med I’ve ever taken. Hands down.",0,55,1
"Methamphetamine","JustAnotherPatient","January 14, 2019","-","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 With this review, I want to cover two things: 1. Effectiveness of the medication itself First, I have to say, after dealing with depression and ADD for most of my life, and having tried literally every conventional anti-depressant and ADD medication, I can honestly and without hesitation say that Desoxyn is the absolute best medication I've ever used to treat my ADD. Ritalin worked for a brief period of time, then the side effects would dominate the efficacy with concentration. I generally felt like I had consumed too much coffee when I took Ritalin. Dexedrine made me feel hyper and edgy. Adderall was even worse, with Peripheral Nervous System stimulation that made my body sweat, my mind dart back and forth, and my stomach turn in knots. It was a miserable experience. I wanted something different. I met with a new provider, who was very open minded when it came to medication and alternative therapies.....",0,41,1
"Methamphetamine","ADHD63","June 27, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have been diagnosed with ADHD for the past 20 years and have been successfully treated with a variety of CNS medications. I did best on cylert but then they removed it from the US market. The issue with the other CNS stimulants is that they seem to loose effectiveness over time. I read the + reviews on desoxyn/methaphetamine and went to my treating psychiatrist who prescribed me a trial dose of 5 mg 2 times a day - which was not very effective. When increased to 10mg 2 times a day I found the medication very effective over the past 6 months. My MD then began to show his personal bias against this medication and abruptly discontinued the desoxyn and replaced it with ritalin which is far less effective. My message to others - there is such clear bias against this specific ADHD CNS med - and finding a pharmacy that will have it in stock when you need a refill is such a major problem - you must be willing to go to battle with the medical and phamacy communities. Wishing you the best!",10,10,1
"Methamphetamine","oldkaw","January 15, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 Adderall was originally called Obetrol  before Shire reincarnated it years later. Obetrol was a mix of dextro/levo amphetamine/methamphetamine. The best tool you could have in your tool box to treat ADD would be 10mg of Adderall combined with 20mg of Desoxyn BID or TID. Please speak with your physician.",0,39,1
"Methamphetamine","MPGOH","December 12, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 I have tried Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin, and other formulations... all of which had issues. Adderall was the worst, or most notable at least, due to the extreme anger, frustration, tendency towards violence, physical tension, and horrible comedowns. I cannot tolerate more than 20-30mg of this medication, period. Ritalin on the other hand, was very good for some tasks like school work, and math problems. However, it dulled my emotions and made me feel less... like me?  Desoxyn feels smooth, positive, and had the least negative physical side-effects. The focus was not as intense as other Amphetamines, but I felt that it allowed me to have more control over my emotions than any other ADHD medication... while feeling sober.",0,47,1
"Methamphetamine","Lykiana","October 12, 2017","-","I was in 8th grade.  I had no problems other then ADD.  My doctor prescribed this to me.  I was on it for a few years.  After a few weeks it was hectic.  I’d take them and be super sensitive to light. My head would be pounding.  I’d sleep in the middle of the floor in a pitch dark room just because the cold felt nice on my pounding head.  If it wasn’t that. It was hot and cold flashes.  When I didn’t take them, I'd have super bad breathing problems and I’d panic. The littlest thing would set me off.  I’m now 20 years old. I have major anxiety problems that started when I stopped taking it.  Of course most of my anxiety disorders were personal expierence and trauma but my main anxiety, the random attacks, were caused by this medication.",1,2,1
"Methamphetamine","Narcolepsynightmare","September 17, 2017","-","<b>Desoxyn Gradumet (methamphetamine):</b>			 This medication is not indicated for ADHD or ADD in adults. It is neurotoxic and highly addictive. Comments to the contrary are idiotic. As an attorney, I've seen dozens of parents choose desoxyn (methamphetamine) over their kids. It should only be used as a last resort for central sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Even for narcolepsy, the maximum indicated dose is 60mg, not 70.",0,5,1
"Methamphetamine","Anonymous","March 7, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","<b>Desoxyn (methamphetamine):</b>			 How is this not more widely prescribed? My doc had me on Strattera at first, didn't help at all. Next I switched to Concerta, which worked, but  increased my anxiety, and I had a crash. Next I switched to Adderall, which had almost the same effect as Concerta but on top of that I had no appetite. Finally I switched to Desoxyn and that's when my life started to turn around. My grades instantly went up and homework became fun for me. Math problems became like a puzzle, and history became fun, like watching a real-life movie. Right when I made the switch to Desoxyn, I got caught up on ALL my homework and my grades instantly switched from D's and F's to B's and A's. Not only that, but my social anxiety was completely GONE.",0,89,1
"Methamphetamine","RIck K.","January 23, 2017","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I barely had enough time in the day to meet the obligations of my job until I began taking methamphetamine. It really energized me to focus on the task at hand and nothing else. Shortly after I began taking Methamphetamine I received two promotions at work and was given an additional supervisory role.  As an added benefit it curbed my appetite allowing me to work through lunch and in some cases even dinner without taking a break. Also there is almost no physical side effect, unlike Vyvanse and Amphetamine Salts made my body and head ache as well as gave me a craving to chain smoke.  The only downside is the availability at the local chemist, it seems the refills can only be handled through a tribal doctor or local shaman.",8,16,1

IT is more effective for performing my scores on tests and learning.  It is better for the social anxiety component of ADHD. It is neurotoxic so you may not want to stay on it for the entire year, however, IT DOES have medical value at low doses if used by RESPONSIBLE users for several months out of the year. IT IS very effective for controlling treatment resistant depression and appetite problems as well. However, appetite would return to baseline when stopping Desoxyn.

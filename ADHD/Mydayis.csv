"Mydayis","Nicole","January 9, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.",5,21,1
"Mydayis","Aiden","October 20, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once &amp; my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.",8,4,1
"Mydayis","Prius","October 14, 2019","-","I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.",7,5,1
"Mydayis","Thank you lord","October 3, 2019","-","I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.",10,16,1
"Mydayis","molly","August 5, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with",7,20,1
"Mydayis","Allie","July 27, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.",3,19,1
"Mydayis","Faifai","June 20, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Wow. This stuff is so effective I don't even notice it coming or going. I've tried most of all of the ADHD medications and this one helped a lot of my major symptoms but it I still find myself randomly starting a project without finishing it. Usually I take both or switch around adderall IR zenzedi then a long term one like this or vyvanse. I like it loads more to vyvanse. I've been on all of these for the most of 12 years and if its helping my dry mouth without affecting my appetite I'm happy. Note I do not even feel Adderall or anything kick in, but with this one I just notice I'm randomly being more productive and so even at max dose I have no idea what your tolerance is. Way better than the  generic adderall XR. It's like the adults adderall XR that lasts a really long time.",10,15,1
"Mydayis","The chaiwallah","June 14, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been taking Mydayis for 2 months. I switched from 25 mg of generic Adderal XR because of the afternoon crash, to 37mg of Mydayis for more support in the evening. I was expecting it to have the same effect, but I didn't feel like it was working at first. I was starting to feel more and more tired, along with a slower and slower processing speed. I struggle with sluggish cognitive tempo, which is currently diagnosed as ADHD inattentive subtype. I asked my doctor to try 50mg because it felt weak. I have been on it for 2 weeks now and I feel like myself again and I and really appreciate the support it provides in the evening. I'm still just a little confused as to why the generic version at 25 mg felt stronger than the brand name at 37! The only negative side effect at this point is that my scalp had been really itchy. I'm hoping that will go away after a few more weeks.",8,15,1
"Mydayis","Anonymous1989","May 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have had ADD my entire life (I'm 30), starting treatment with dexedrine in kindergarten. I've tried literally every ADD drug there is except Zenzedi and Desoxyn (methamphetamine HCL). I've even tried modafinil. Chemically Vyvanse, dexedrine, and Zenzedi are the same with just different absorption. Adderall is 80% dexedrine with 20% levoamphetamine, which is more physically stimulating than dextroamphetamine. If you are like me, hate stimulants because of the crash at night and morning exhaustion, I  need a drug that lasts all day and is smooth then consider Mydayis. I only wrote this to help anyone who's considering Mydayis. I would never waste my time helping any pharm company with a review. Mydayis is unique and different from Adderall and the other dextroamphetamine stimulants because it has amphetamine in addition to other dex salts. Give it a try... If you have trouble with insomnia from taking it then your dose is too high!! Just drop it. Good luck",9,41,1
"Mydayis","Madison Grooters","April 25, 2019","-","I am diagnosed  Concurrent Concussion Syndrome with ADD symptoms. I took Vyvanse for over a year and I thought I loved it, until I realized it gave me anxiety because I was trying to cram 16 hours worth of homework and chores into the short period of time the medication worked. My neurologist had me switch to taking Mydayis and I have loved it because I do not feel the  high  that vyvanse gives you, and in turn I also do not feel the medication slowing down either. Now, I still take it at 5:30am, but I can do homework or concentrate on other tasks well past 8 or 9 pm.  Advantages: -long lasting -continuous feeling throughout day (no ups and downs) Disadvantages: -makes me not feel hungry -loss of appetite can make low blood sugar hit me all at once if I forget to eat  -if I sleep in on the weekends I can’t take it because it will last too long Hope my experience helps! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for longer lasting stimulants, but I know that everyone reacts to things differently so it might not work for you",9,26,1
"Mydayis","Jenjen","March 14, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was put on Mydayis and for six months I absolutely loved it, it worked so well.  At the time I had a coupon so after the coupon  expired and even with insurance is way too expensive every month so had to switch. I would’ve been on loyal customer to,  but  Mydayis is just way way too expensive! I don’t understand why you make a drug and it works for people and every day people can’t afford it. Even with insurance.",9,42,1
"Mydayis","Ima fan","February 28, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I love mydayis. It's been the best medication for ADHD I've tried so far. It lasts pretty much all day as long as I keep my blood sugar up, (which is hard because it kills my appetite) and it is very effective. It gives a lower more prolonged peak than straight adderall, and doesn't have as many side effects. The biggest downside is that it is extremely expensive, insurance doesn't cover it, and the 2019 coupon doesn't cover as much as the 2018 one.",9,26,1
"Mydayis","Deby","February 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I'm a big fan of this medication 50mg and the triple-bead release system that keeps it from pooping out midday. I've had zero side effects since I started and my only complaint is the cost a whopping $300 some dollars for a 30-day supply compared to $50 for Vyvanse 70mg which isn't nearly as effective for me. I used to be on just quick release Adderall but those days are long gone as far as effectiveness goes",9,14,1
"Mydayis","Norwegian11156","February 23, 2019","-","I might be jumping the gun with the 1/10 and stopping it after two days, but this drug is god awful. My pharmacist friend told me the bad reviews on here were from people that expected the same high as adderall, or that they were expecting it to be bad, so it worked that way. Well, I tried it once without eating and once with eating to make sure... both days were horrible. This morning, I woke up 2 hrs after taking it with a resting heart rate of 140 bpm and would have gone to the hospital if I didn’t find my blood pressure medication (for reference, I don’t have an existing heart condition, it is for anxiety). I’ve been severely depressed, I’ve had muscle pain, nausea and I was wired. The  I’m vibrating and I’m paranoid and I’m scared  wired. It didn’t treat any  ADHD  symptoms. I don’t know what the heck they’re putting in this drug that they aren’t putting in the adderall.",1,14,1
"Mydayis","JJ","February 14, 2019","-","I do not like this medicine at all. I feel awful! I screwed up on my test and studying because of it. It is not for me. I was on vyvanse,  but the only issue that I had with vyvanse was that it only lasted 4 hours! I miss vyvanse so my much. It made me feel so good and more confident and my focus was on a thousand and it helped with some anxiety! My doctor and I wanted to give Mydayis a try, because it lasts longer.  It does last longer , but I feel depressed,  lazy, less focused and just drugged and that's it.  I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to let him know , I can't stand this drug at all! I want vyvanse back right away. I really do hope that they can accommodate me. I will give this mydayis to the pharmacy,  so that my health insurance will know that, I'm not trying to keep it. It's been only a week since I have been on it. I'm not a fan at all . I want off.  It's messing me up.",2,19,1

I have a pretty hard time with tolerance issues which led me to abuse the vyvanse. This led me to switch to Adderall IR twice daily. Still didn’t fix the problem. Ask my psych about Mydayis and I can tell you it has an effect all day (definitely more then Adderall XR &amp; Vyvanse) it gives you a more calming feeling while adderall caused anxiety &amp; I felt I needed valium. My psychiatrist doesn’t mess around and since I’ve been taking amphetimines for years, he put me right on the highest dose 50mg. So far so good...",9,22,1
"Mydayis","Anonymous","January 14, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I loved it at first! Because it gave me the concentration I needed without a lot of the side effects. Also it lasted all day, but still leg me sleep. But I keep building a tolerance and now I'm on 37.5mg. One thing I really didn't like was how hard it was to get it. It is a relatively new drug that is in high demand so I've run into some shortages.",7,11,1
"Mydayis","ADDventurer","December 28, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I received mydayis 25mg 2.5 months ago for severe combined type ADHD (also started lamictal at that time). After taking the 25mg dose for 2 months, I was not impressed. Mydayis seemed to work OK when beginning lamictal, but the effects declined as the lamictal titration from 25mg to 200mg maintenance dose. The benefit of mydayis, was increased alertness on morning commute to work, and a general calming. My focus and concentration remained impaired. The  Dr bumped mydayis to 37.5mg and feel calmer and less impulsive, and alertness is increased to the point of insomnia. No relief of concentration or problems forgetting things, losing items etc. In fact I feel quite depressed and drugged.",4,14,1

I was on Vyvanse for the last 3 years and eventually built up a tolerance to it. I like how Mydayis doesn't give me that nervous, heart-racing feeling like Adderall and some of the other drugs do. It's not going to give you an intense rush, but provides a steady, long lasting feeling of alertness &amp; focus. It doesn't affect my appetite, sleep or mood.",8,16,1
"Mydayis","Mydayis better","October 27, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I was taking Adderall 20 mg twice a day. It made me anxious and almost paranoid at times. I had extreme highs and extreme lows but I could focus. I have been on Mydayis for a week now and I do not have the anxiety I had with Adderrall and I am not super hyperfocused and chatty like I was on Adderrall. Mydayis feels more natural if that makes sense. I feel more myself now and even my bf said he notices a change. A good change. Also, I had a bit of sexual blah and found it difficult to be happy and Mydayis gave me my groove back. I can easily fall asleep but I noticed if I don't lay down and settled, I can stay up. I can definitely fall asleep on it. I like it. I think it depends on the person. I myself don't like feeling like I am bouncing off the walls and Mydayis doesn't make me feel that way but I am more organized and productive. Worth a try to see if it works for you. Feels healthier.",8,27,1

But after 1 month all hell broke lose. Began to notice an odd feeling of like flat line, not happy, not sad. I then got this odd feeling in my chest about 2 p.m. every day + anxious.

"Mydayis","Dee","October 1, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Mydayis is truly life changing. It provides consistent and even focus throughout my long days at work. No highs and lows in my attention to detail and focus at accomplishing my daily tasks. I hated the highs and lows associated with taking the instant release and the relatively short total duration of effectiveness of extended release. It’s NOT for someone looking for big energy boosts but for ADULTS who struggle daily with focus, attention and productivity. One capsule each day is all it takes to truly give you the life you’ve been missing. Absolutely amazing! !",10,24,1
"Mydayis","monica","September 26, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I change meds frequently because I build tolerance really fast. Almost every year I switch, and most recently switched from Adderall XR 60mg + IR 30 mg booster to 62.5 mg Mydayis. I LOVE this medication. It runs in the background, so I feel almost no anxiety anymore-- it's not nearly as aggressive. I even stopped needing my anxiety meds. I like to take my pills around 7-7:30, then go back to sleep til 9:30 or so. It is perfect timing for my days. And you don't have to eat when you take these, so it's possible to just roll over and go back to sleep til it's time for breakfast.",10,24,2

Vyvanse was good but it took two hours to kick in and wore off about 5-6 hours after it kicked in for me. ( I am likely a fast metabolizer) I am now feeling lazy, a little depressed, and I am eating more food.  I can not tell when it hits or wears off. Doesn’t feel like it’s doing much. Maybe my dose was too low? Not sure if I will try a higher dose or change back to Vyvanse. Wish I know how to compare dosages between Vyvanse and Mydayis.",3,14,2

"Mydayis","Normal","September 4, 2018","-","I first was recommended Vyvanse and it worked well for about 2.5 years but it did not last for 16 hours as I needed to have energy and focus for work until 10 pm.  I dislike taking the powder at a different time during the day.  My Doctor recommended Adderall XR for 1.5 years which allowed me a pill form that I could break up.  That is when I learned about Mydayis and because my day starts at 6 am to 10 pm I felt this would be ideal for me.  Hoestly, I read the message board and got scared becasue of all the wild side effects mentioned.  None of those things happen to me.  Same side effects as the other two for me but Mydayis allows me to take one pill which last 16 hours and has improved my focus, energy and moods.  I use to talk to much when my previous pills were its peak but I am less apt to do that now.  I feel both pill worked very well just Mydayis works better.  I am unsure why it just does.

Doctor changed my script to Mydayis (2/37,5's a day). If I compare them to chocolate...Adderall is Hershey's and Mydayis is Godiva. It takes a bit to kick in...but once it does, I am so focused on whats in front of me. Side effects are minimal compared to how it helps me operate daily in life. With Adderall I felt a rush using it. With Mydayis, no rush its a smooth transition. On Adderall, I couldn't get out of bed on my rest days and on Mydayis I'm a little slower on off days, but not much - just not as much focus of course.

"Mydayis","Lane","August 6, 2018","-","I have been taking Mydayis/25mg for 2 months, and I have experienced ZERO negative side effects.  I was previously prescribed Adderall XR &amp; IR and Vyvanse. Those medications were somewhat effective; however, they came with a lot of side effects (loss of appetite, moodiness, insomnia, heart palpitations, dry mouth, dry skin and anxiousness). The best thing about Mydayis is the way in which it feels natural, and the way it steadily tapers off throughout the day. With previous medications, I could actually feel the effects coming and going and I would get these sensations of feeling high. With Mydayis, I never actually FEEL the medication taking effect, but I can tell a HUGE difference in my performance, mood and ability to focus. I even feel relaxed, as if my mind can finally make sense of racing thoughts and feelings. I usually take my medication around 8 AM and I am easily able to fall asleep by 11 PM.

Like not to just focus on one to do but to finish it and to keep my mind from straying too much on everything around me. And I hardly ever had a completely thought about anything. It was constant chaos. My doctor suggested mydayis because it has three time release capsule without the extreme highs and lows like afterlife. And you don’t have to take it all day. Just once and I never feel a crash or depressed from a sudden down of drugs in my system because of the three release thing. The only time I can really tell I’ve taken it is in the morning.

I am so focused and get so much done. Not just at work but around the house. I can work until 10 and go to sleep or work until 3am if I choose. It’s been wonderful for the 6 months I’ve been on it. I have never tried anything else but last time I visited my therapist a few days ago she asked me if it made me moody and irritable and I said no it puts me in a good mood and works all day.

The first week I felt disoriented and every time I went to bed all my muscles felt VERY sore, especially my legs. It felt like I had run 20 miles and every time I moved the soreness woke me up. Then, one night when trying to fall asleep I heard voices, it was the sound of many people talking, like if I was at a very crowded restaurant.

It is released three times a day which is a release after taking it, during mid day, and afternoon and you basically stay focused all day. ADHD medicine is an individual thing because Mydayis works for me but someone else might not like it. Like people rave about Vyvanse but it didn't do much for me.

Good for some people and not good for others.  With any med if the side affects overshadow the benefits then it isn’t for you. Mydayis works like Vyvanse but initially didn’t need the boost.

Mydayis: 12 hrs, still feel working within first 30-60 mins like adderrall, my appetite came BACK with this, no coming down feeling, but the overall effectiveness of helping with focusing sometimes isn’t as much.

"Mydayis","Anonymous","November 2, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I was taking Adderall XR 25 mg daily, and it was wearing off very quickly.  Mydayis sounded like a dream, last’s the whole day, and a manufacturer coupon that left me with a $3 copay!! That dream turned into a nightmare when it managed to trigger my bipolar depression... let’s just say I’ve missed the past week of my life due to this drug.  I wouldn’t recommend this medication to my worst enemy!! Buyer beware especially if you have comorbid conditions like bipolar depression!!",0,13,4
"Mydayis","Jdoawg","November 2, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Mydayis works great if you are on the right dose.  I noticed some people on here are not getting the right strength when converting from Vyvanse or Adderall. To the person who’s doctor switched you from 70 of Vyvanse to 25mg of Mydayis - your getting less medication! That’s why it’s not working for you. You should be taking 50mg. You will notice a  BIG difference!",9,17,4
"Mydayis","KatieS.","October 9, 2017","-","I've recently switched from Adderall (the generic version) to mydayis for my ADHD and have been noticing really intense dehydration about 3-4 hours after I take it. I'm shaky, feel nausea, I have the runs, and I also feel like I get easily distracted... all of the time! Like now. I'm literally supposed to be working lol and I started researching mydayis side effects.  I thankfully have my Dr on Wednesday, so I think I'll be switching back to my generic adderall. I was very happy on that and got dehydrated on that as well but I would just drink water and be fine. Now I feel like I'm drinking all of the water/electrolytes in the world and still feel awful =\  I really wanted to like this medication but I think it's not worth it actually :(",0,18,4
"Mydayis","Confused office manager","October 6, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I was prescribed vyvanse chewable 30 mg in the am and 30 at noon. I loved it, but had a month where I didn't take it regularly at noon. Dr suggested this because of the extended release. 2 weeks in: My sleep is concerning. I haven't hit rem in 3 days now. I have no appetite even in the am before I take the mydayis. I have to force feed myself, even icecream is a struggle after the 3rd bite. The 2-3 hours after I take it I feel lost, can't track conversations,  no/minimal recall, I can't even prioritize. After those hours things level out a bit, but I don't have the motivation I had with Vyvanse.  I believe there is link between loss of quality sleep and stuggling to meet my dietary requirements and how the drug affects me.",4,14,4
"Mydayis","Alex1321","October 4, 2017","-","Taking 25mg right now and was on adderall XR 30mg.  I don't understand this medicine since it usually makes me tired and down for about 2-3 hours after taking it then get an okay amount of focus for another 6-8 hours.  I personally can't deal with those 3 hours everyday when I need to be productive so I will try something else. This drug may be very similar to the chemicals in adderall but it definitely does not feel like it.",5,16,4
"Mydayis","R1ch1e","September 24, 2017","-","I switched to Mydayis from Vyvanse. The effects of Mydayis last longer than Vyvanse, but just as—in my experience—Vyvanse did not last fourteen hours, Mydayis’s duration of action falls short of the sixteen hours as advertised by Shire. Nonetheless, I still hold Mydayis superior to Vyvanse and Adderall.",8,27,4
"Mydayis","Anonymous","September 18, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","It takes too long to kick in, I have to get up hours before I am suppose to just to take it so I am alert at work.  I was just sitting here today trying to figure why I have been so tired and sad and I started reading the side effects and now it all makes sense.  I am going to keep taking it until my month is  up and if it doesn't get better I am going back to my vyvance and adderall.",0,15,4
"Mydayis","Jala","September 17, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Mydayis 50mg has worked great for me. It did take a week or so for me to notice any real benefits. The first day I was a bit on edge. Then I was depressed slightly for about a week. It wasn’t major depression, just a general  down  feeling. After the second week I have seemed more focused.  My energy and motivation seems to be increasing slightly. This drug has a very smooth transition. I don't crash or have periods of high heart rates and anxiety. I was on adderall 30mg previously. I also have tried vyvanse and concerta in the past with poor results.",0,30,4
"Mydayis","ljuls","September 15, 2017","-","Not at all what I expected. Have used Vyvanse with success, but went back to adderall, more flexibility dosing. Can take a second dose during the day if necessary, or not.  Mydayis takes an unusually long time to kick in. Have found that I am much more irritable, foggy, and have experienced feelings of being overwhelmed at work doing things that I normally handle day in and day out with no problem.  I am for the most part easy going, everything seems to annoy me since I began using Mydayis. Also have experienced headaches during lag times, body aches, and flu like symptoms.  A lot of the time I feel worse than I do un-medicated. Do not like Mydayis at all. Will not be refilling.",2,20,4
"Mydayis","ADD Mommy","September 13, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I wanted this medication to work because I often forget to take my second generic adderral dose on time. However, Mydayis is not the wonder drug I wanted it to be. It takes up to 2 hours to kick in (something they hide in the facts) and even though I worked this drawback by waking up earlier to take it there wasn't enough positives to keep me taking it past week four. It lasted about 6 hours before it quickly declined and leaving me with even worse ADD symptoms. It was so bad I couldn't have a conversation or focus enough to make dinner without skipping into laundry, cleaning, or some other distractions. Without the use of any medication I have never had symptoms this bad. If this wasn't bad enough I had horrible nausea and indigestion.",1,19,4
"Mydayis","SummerMermaid","September 13, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","Meh. I was on Vyvanse, 70 mg/day &amp; switched to Mydayis 25 mg/day. NOT what I was hoping for. Not by a Long Shot. While it lasts longer than VYVANSE (was on Vyvanse for years) which only gave me about 5/6 hours in the end, it gives me MUCH LESS motivation. Makes me depressed. I'm Very Sorry I did not only get Only a 2 week supply rather than 1 month. I have no insurance &amp; it was about $100 more than Vyvanse. Needless to say, I will request Vyvanse again at my next appt. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.",1,16,5

"Mydayis","Dani e","September 12, 2017","-","I was prescribed 50 mg. 1st day I could literally feel the release of the medication. During the lag of the release I would get headaches, become tired, irritable and frustrated with every situation and conversation. By evening time I couldn't carry a conversation without forgetting prior known facts. Saturday ,I was completely not myself. On top of how I felt  Friday I was emotional, had down thoughts, I couldn't follow a time line: I was late for everything. Sunday seemed to be better but not by much. Monday..horrible it was like I added Friday and  Saturday symptoms together then add in horrible chest pain, shortness of breath, constant feeling of about to faint, fever, flu symptoms, hot/cold, exhausted but not able to sleep, &amp; more symptoms. I refuse to take another dose",1,14,5
"Mydayis","Amesk123","September 8, 2017","-","I was prescribed 30 mg XR of adderall plus 20 mg tabs per day, my doctor switched my to one 25 mg Mydayis and it was horrible...well it was horrible because technically it was a very dramatic decrease in dose. After a week of being down, tired, foggy and emotional I called my doctor to increase. I honestly think 50 mg of Mydayis is comparable to 30 mg xr adderall, but lasts longer.",0,18,5
"Mydayis","ABCDR","September 7, 2017","-","Not helpful for hyperactivity. Lasts a long time but doesn't help much.  On 50mg but maybe the dose recommendation is too low.",2,9,5
"Mydayis","Samual Adams","September 3, 2017","-","Never had so many thoughts really down thoughts as I did well on this medication. Also, daily dosage only lasted 4-6 hours before effect decreased rapidly. Generic Adderall lasts longer with no downers. This one was not the godsend I had hoped it would be.",1,15,5

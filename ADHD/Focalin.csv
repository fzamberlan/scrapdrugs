"Focalin","A kiddo - 13","May 21, 2020","-","I’m scrolling through reviews and a lot of what I’ve been feeling recently is starting to make sense - this medicine helps me focus but I feel weak and awful while on it. It makes me shake and my anxiety spikes  I’ve also been having some depression issues -  my moods stoop to a terrible level and I’ve been in such a dark place at some points.  This medicine makes me feel like a zombie, it makes me shake and feel sick to my stomach  I feel bad for any other kids taking this It helps me focus but makes me feel awful  I absolutely DREAD having to take them  I have experienced depersonalization, depression, major mood swings, anxiety, derealization, and suicidal tendencies after getting on this medication  I am not self diagnosing for anxiety and depression I strongly advise watching your kids before and after having them take these pills-  Make sure your child is safe and happy.  I’m sorry for my terrible grammar and typing skills-",3,3,1
"Focalin","kat","April 27, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Focalin 40 mg XR. I found that that this medication was mostly ineffective. If anything it has an initial kick and wears off extremely fast. I thought it would be like adderall xr which I could feel the effects come and go throughout the day at 30 mg. With focalin its just one burst of euphoria/adrenaline/ and then you crash and feel nothing  except for the physical side effects like chest pain, rapid heart beat, muscle tenseness. I took a nap 2.5 hours after taking it which is ridiculous. It is frustrating because you don't feel the sense of focus that adderall gives. I only took it for two days before I called it quits because I did not see a benefit and decided to go back to adderall 20 mg IR. This medication did not suit me as a 27 year old grad student. I felt anxiety and panic attack symptoms with the second dose I took and I did not want to continue. It actually had a negative impact on my work input for those two days.",1,4,1

"Focalin","Biodigitaljazzman","March 26, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","To start off, I would not recommend taking this drug Focalin unless absolutely necessary. It definitely helped me pay attention in school, and there was a noticeable difference between days I did take it, and days I did not. However, for me at least, the side-effects outweighed the benefits. I'd been on it from the ages of 7-17, and throughout those years I noticed a complete change in behavior. Muted emotions, loss of appetite, depression, insomnia. I paid more attention in school, sure, but all of those years I'd lost important emotional development time. It's only after being off of this drug for 5 years that I realize just how emotionally stunted it had made me over the years. I'm in college now, and admittedly it would help me get better grades. But I wouldn't take it again if someone paid me to do it.",6,8,1

"Focalin","Coco channel 4","February 16, 2020","-","My son 12 years old and in 7th grade.  He was tested for ADD in 3rd grade by using the Quotient testing system which showed that he did not have it.  Clinical signs were there.  We tried low dosage 5-7mg of vyvanse, Adderall, Quanfacine. The worst 2 years of his life.  He did not have problems with good grades to begin with but just could not focus at school or home.  That landed him in more trouble with the teachers.  Took him off for 5th and 6th grade.   7th grade has been a nightmare.  Grades for the first time  were horrible and ALL 6 teachers said he can’t focus and they became aggravated but not because he was disrespectful but cause they were tired of redirecting him.  So back to the dr we go 2nd semester. They put him on focalin xr and. Wow what a difference.  He has bumped up to 10mg.  He can tell the difference himself.  He said mom I kinda felt like a genius today instead of saying I can’t do it, it’s to hard.  Focalin has the least amount of side effects by far.",10,14,1

Now one takes focalin other ritalin and the son on focalin is a lot nicer I can rest now I can manage them.  If they don't take it it's a hard day for all of us",10,15,1
"Focalin","The Fantastical Poodle Plunger","October 22, 2019","-","45 year old male with depression and ADD.  I started with Focalin 20mg XR once a day, then 5 years later my doc added a regular 10mg dose in the afternoon. This has been a fantastic medicine for me. Would not be able to perform at work without it. Two negative side effects (but the benefits outweigh them): 1) Intestinal discomfort and bowel movement like clock work about 60-90 minutes after I take it in the morning. I have to avoid scheduling meetings for that time. 2)  meth dick  or  meth penis  which basically is caused by reduced blood flow to appendages. Get cold hands and feet too. Luckily it doesn’t impact size of erection since blood is flowing then. It’s just ego bruising when shrinkage occurs. On the weekends I skip the 20mg dose and take 10mg around noon so I don’t have to take two doses, also giving my body and brain a rest from the stimulant. My appendages feel warmer too. But I am happy my doc prescribed this to me. Absolutely huge life changer for me.",8,14,1
"Focalin","Ali","October 4, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Please please do not use focalin if you have depression or anxiety, or prone to addiction. I have severe ADD and I was prescribed focalin 2 years ago. When I would come down off of it, it made me so unbearably sad and near suicidal so I would take more just to not kill myself. This led to a severe addiction that nearly gave me brain damage. Please be safe. Good grades aren’t worth the pain this drug put me through.",2,26,1
"Focalin","j","August 27, 2019","-","For me, Focalin has had way more negative effects than positive. My doc started me off with 10mg in the morning and then another 10mg in the afternoon. Now I’m on 20mg in the morning, 20 mg in the afternoon. It helps my concentration and ADHD issues for maybe the first 2 hours or less after each dose, but then from there, it causes terrible anxiety, depression. It makes things worse than actually helping when it starts wearing off (which is very quickly). Overall, I don't like Focalin at all. It not only comes with mental side effects like I mentioned but also physical side effects as well such as: shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, constant feeling like I have to urinate but can’t, fatigue, etc. It’s been over 3 months and it hasn’t helped my ADHD consistently or effectively anywhere close to stabilizing and treating it. Please consider other ADHD meds before going with Focalin for you / your child’s ADHD problems. It certainly hasn’t been the answer for me.",3,20,1

Adderall XR worked but I thought that there must be something better, so my doctor put me on Focalin. Today has been my third day on the new medication and I feel awful. As someone who has acid reflux, Focalin worsened by heart burn and caused me to gag every 10 minutes for no reason. Folcalin barely helped me focus during my class and I couldn't drive because of how weak I was and how much I shook. This medicine has given me diarrhea and constant headaches. Needless to say I will be going back to Adderall XR.",2,13,1

"Focalin","Annie","March 12, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","My 6 year old was placed on focalin xr after a lot of stress on if we should even do medication. We thought we would give it a try when my daughter was diagnosed with ADHD combined type. My daughter was not a behavior issue, but was extremely floppy and would twirl, lay on the ground in public and leap around. It was like she could not control her body at all. She also could barely look at you in the eye when you were telling her something-- it was like she was always in another world. She also only ever felt satisfied by TV and videos and all other activities were too boring to hold her attention. I was stressed that she felt so out of control. We tried focalin 10 mg and saw an instant change with very little side effects. We had to move up after about 2 months to 15 mg because the inability to control her body came back--but focus was alright.",10,45,1

If you read up on this medicine the FDA is asking for that to become one of the side effect warnings for this medication. My daughter was placed in a behavioral center that could help her and she has not took anymore ADHD medication since that day. She told me (her mom) I will never do that again but that medicine made me feel so sad and my thoughts weren't my own. Never again will my daughter take this medication or anything for ADHD!",0,21,1
"Focalin","prettylittledancer","January 19, 2018","-","The doctor started me off with 10 mg seemed to never fully kick in, I would feel some effects, mostly just I would stare out into space and daydream. I told my doctor this and he just said I needed to refocus my focus. (He's a hippy Y'all) Then when I finally convinced him up it to see if I would actually feel anything more, it just amps my anxiety and makes me extremely tired. You can forget about taking a second extended-release capsule after that one wears off, it just makes you more tired and amps your anxiety more, makes you jittery and really on edge, also makes your heart beat incredibly fast. Would not recommend.",2,13,1
"Focalin","MonsterHair","December 23, 2017","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I take the smallest dose of 5 mg Focalin XR. I've been on the same dosage for years now. I find it's like a small cup of coffee in how stimulating it is. I find that is also has a side benefit of being a mood stabilizer as well. It also helps me with my mild OCD behaviors, which I notice as the meds wear off. I never noticed my OCD before, but as it wears off, I do now, and can at least be aware of them when I'm not on my meds. I've accidentally taken 2 pills before, and it felt like my head was floating above my body. Strange, and not recommended. Also, don't go for the big dose right away.",9,23,1

I'm also very jittery non stop moving and sweaty. I'm hungry to the point of feeling faint, but can't eat bc even the thought of eating makes me want to throw up. Some days my heart feels like it's beating out of my chest. I always wake up at 6am feeling great and fall back asleep and wake up later feeling like rubbish.

At first I figured well maybe he is just a kid who needs glasses. His prescription was very low. Now a year and a half later his principal from his school called me because he failed the state eye test with his glasses on he has a 20/50 vision. So I took him back to the doctor and they could not correct his vision with the strongest prescription. Everything is blurry and out of focus, he lost all peripheral vision on both eyes. The doctors first question was What medication is he on? So I advised him Focalin 10mg. He advised me to immediately go to the doctor who prescribed it because it is a severe side effect of Focalin.

It got so bad that we called the police to find out what our options were if he were to actually hurt us or his little sister.  He never hurt us, but did break a window, the screen door, and throw objects.  Needless to say, we stopped the meds and thankfully we have our sweet son back (although he can't focus and is annoying to other kids in his class).

If you are having trouble sleeping on this drug here's what you do and here's what I did: prior to now, I was taking my medication at 11am or 10am. Often I would spend nights awake and panicky just begging for sleep to come. This is a simple fix. Just wake yourself up at like 6am every day to take it and you shouldn't have any problem sleeping.

Due to me going untreated for my entire childhood, I dropped out. I'm back in school now and it's been 2 years. If it gets to the point where you want to drop out I suggest add medication. But if you have a 3-10 year old I highly don't suggest it. When my brother was 4-7/8 he was on it. He would always try to kill me and my mother. He would hurt animals and kids at school. He was quiet and had no emotion or expression. Tried to kill himself many times. To this day he is now 18 and 5'8 when he is supposed to be over 6ft because our genes.

"Focalin","KarPete","October 3, 2014","-","We started our 8 year old son (then) on Methyphenidate I think 10mg. Then went up to 20 mg. That was disastrous after a few months with the tantrums, weight loss and anorexia. We had him switched to Vyvanse 20 mg per day for a few months. Anorexia continued and after those few months, he became yellowish skinned, almost jaundiced. He got toxic obviously so we detoxed him with some fish oil supplements and some other herbal remedies. About 2 weeks later we put him on Focalin XR 5mg. His focus is starting to dwindle now that school started. We added the Focalin 2.5mg to the morning regimen to boost the dosage a little faster (that one is faster absorbed also). Have not heard anything negative from the teacher so we are crossing our fingers.",0,36,2

He is supposed to take 5mg non extended release after school, however, I hardly give that to him anymore.  I sometimes break the 5mg pill in half and just have him take 2.5mg to focus on his homework, if I see him struggling.

It is important, at least for our family, to ensure he's part of the treatment plan and feel in control of this as well. Also, my son communicates with us on how it makes him feel and the only worry I have when he's taking this is his loss of appetite or not eating enough.

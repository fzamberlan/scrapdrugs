"Dextroamphetamine","Les","May 28, 2020","-","I was a horrible student all through High School. I was convinced I was stupid. I became the class clown to hide my shame. That was fifty years ago. Now, at seventy I look back on the career I forged as a successful television writer, knowing I couldn’t have done it without Dexedrine. For me it was magical—smooth and non addicting. Yes, it can get the ticker beating more rapidly at times. Because of this and heart disease in my family my cardiologist suggested I stop. I did and have not been as productive since. Stopping the medication after having taken it daily for over twenty five years was simple. No withdrawal. Zero. I slept a little more initially. That is all. True ADD is a tragedy. It robs people from their potential, leaving them shadows of what they could be.  Don’t give up in yourself. If you really do suffer from it—and I mean suffer—find a doctor who specializes in ADD, get tested and get on this medication. A calmer, more productive you awaits.",10,2,1
"Dextroamphetamine","storm","April 17, 2020","-","I was diagnosed with ADHD at 8.I was on Adderall from 13-15. And it worked very well for me, but you know as a teenager you experiment with weed and I failed my drug test and got pulled off of it abruptly. I got terrible withdraws, and was very depressed. I tried medication like Concerta and Lexapro but they didn't work. I gave up on medicine and didn't try anymore for years. I fell behind in school,I had severe anxiety and depression, and had no motivation to even get out of bed. I finally saw a specialist who prescribed 10mg Dextroamphetamine. I am prescribed to take it twice a day as needed I can finally focus on my school work, I can get out of bed in the morning and look forward to the day again. My anxiety has been the lowest it's been in years. The only downfalls I see at the moment are a little bit of an increased heart rate about 30 minutes after I take it, but it goes away within an hour or so. And it has raised my blood pressure, but not to such a height that I should be concerned.",9,3,1

All these are good qualities you think? Not really. I've developed alcoholism, I've never had a financial surplus, I've lost touch with most of my good friends, and I've never accomplished anything I've set myself the goal of.   I began to understand why my life has become so miserable. I started exposing myself for all kinds of things - for the first time I felt solid - a sense of integrity. At the same time, it was a great stress. After a month, I began to think that my whole life had just been a big joke.

"Dextroamphetamine","Michelle","June 27, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","This is a review for the long release generic after 15 yrs. It feels great at first very smooth. However it's socially isolating and in the later years gives anxiety at the same dose and it's very hard to be motivated and focused.  This is the only thing that helped me though for severe ADHD 10 120 pill a month. Another problem is that for rare drugs with street abuse potential the manufacturer and availability is problematic.   The brand when it's too strong will have you sitting in your chair staring acting very pleasant with no thoughts in your head. Now the brand is $ 2665 more then generic for 120 10mg. In the long term, if you don't take little breaks of reducing quantity you will develop tolerance. This means long term depleting dopamine receptors. If you can take a faster release low dose, so less fillers,of a brand medication. Try something weaker  before building tolerance to one of the strongest meds.",6,6,1

"Dextroamphetamine","thomas aquinas","April 9, 2019","-","<b>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):</b>			 The amphetamine molecule has two mirror images of itself. Dexedrine is only one of those images whereas Adderall is both. However, Dexedrine is cheaper and just as tried and true as Adderall. Some Dexedrine generic tablets are scored and come in doses as low as 5mg giving you the ideal opportunity to discus proper individual dosing with your doctor. When I was a kid my doctor had me on too high of a dose. Now I take Dexedrine with my breakfast and don't run into any problems with one cup of coffee. Some of the therapeutic properties of Dexedrine diminish, but the core CNS activity stays pretty reliable at the same dose in my experience. strongly recommend monitoring your kid's prescription bottle. Sometimes smart kids can make mistakes.",0,18,1
"Dextroamphetamine","Axisnegative","February 14, 2019","-","Dextroamphetamine IR (or Zenzedi) is hands down the best ADHD medication I have ever been prescribed. I've been on and off stimulants since middle school (25 years old now) and have tried every medication besides Focalin and Desoxyn. Zenzedi is wonderful because not only does it manage my symptoms much better than Adderall, for example, it also does so with absolute minimal side effects. It doesn't  destroy my appetite, it's easier to get to sleep at night, it doesn't make me irritable or agitated and I'm much less jittery and sweaty (as a result of more CNS stimulation and less PNS). I can also achieve the same effect with a lesser amount of medication (2 x 10mg IR vs 1 x 30mg XR and 1 x 10mg IR). Zenzedi is also surprisingly affordable if you can find a local pharmacy that keeps it in stock. It only ran me $90 before my insurance would cover it vs $200 for Adderall at Walgreens, which usually won't even have Zenzedi in stock. 100% recommended.",10,17,1

"Dextroamphetamine","DivingWhileADHD","November 26, 2018","-","<b>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine):</b>			 This medication is hard to find, which is unfortunate because, quite simply, it works on some ADHD people when other more common medications do not. Dextroamphetamine (generic)/Zenzedi (brand name) acts more on dopamine than norepinephrine. Adderall, which is dextroamp and levoamp, the latter affecting mostly norepinephrine, made me tired and flat--and hungry. Kind of a paradoxical reaction. It helped my emotional overreactivity, but not other ADHD symptoms like initiation of tasks and related anxiety/irritability, procrastination, and negative ruminations (mentally getting stuck). Obviously, my brain needs help with dopamine, and too much norepinephrine is dulling and unpleasantly sedating. Those with similar reactions to Adderall (and/or methylphenidates like Ritalin) might want to give Dextroamphetamine a try. It feels like a totally different class of medication than Adderall to my (admittedly atypical) brain, and works great.",0,58,1

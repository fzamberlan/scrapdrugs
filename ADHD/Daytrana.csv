"Daytrana","Christmasqueen","December 15, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been on the Daytrana patch for almost a week now. My problem was impulse control. I’m 51 years old and I have to say this patch has helped me so very much. My brain and thoughts would not turn off when I went to bed. Now thanks to Daytrana, I’m focused during the day and can easily fall asleep at night. No more issues with impulse control!! Best medication ever. I put the patches  on my hips and  I also use the back of my shoulders as well.",10,3,1
"Daytrana","Jess","October 9, 2018","-","I am 32 years old and have adult ADD. I also have addiction issues and have been sober for 5 years. I haven’t taken any meds since being sober but have been struggling. Last time I tried to take vyvanse and I ended up relapsing. The daytrana patch has been amazing for me. I rated it a 8 just because no ADD meds are perfect and there are side effects. But in my experience I've had a much better time with daytrana then most other meds and seems to be less likely for someone to abuse. Mainly because it lasts all day and there is no  crash  feeling like I've had with others which always trigger me to abuse them. I just wanted to share my experience because it’s really hard to have ADD and not be able to take meds and  addiction problems make this tricky. However, you should give it time once you start it because side effects will lessen once your body adjusts. I experienced extreme lack of appetite and anxiety, both went away after a month.",8,27,1
"Daytrana","Camp","July 16, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My son was diagnosed with ADHD, he is 8 yrs old.  This medication changed his world. Unfortunately no pharmacies in five surrounding counties have the patch and we had to switch to a pill medication which doesn't work for us that well. I hope the patch will come back",10,6,1
"Daytrana","Mumreese","September 5, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","When my son couldn't swallow, the patch was the perfect alternative for his ADD. He never did have the hyperactivity. We used it for years but he developed a nasty allergic skin reaction to it and we had to stop using it. We miss the ease of it and the simplicity of the 8am-6pm use of it. By bedtime he was ready to sleep. With Concerta he has to take Benadryl to help him sleep. If only they could have fixed that problem",8,8,1
"Daytrana","To tired to make name Bla bla","June 30, 2017","-","I was trying to fall asleep for 20 minutes then I said ohh crap I forgot to take it off. So now I will be awake for 3 more hours. It is very bad if you are a busy person like me. Uggg so tired but can't sleep.",8,5,1
"Daytrana","Anonymous","April 11, 2017","-","Tips for taking off the patch:  use oil (we use skin so soft, but any oil will work) to rub into the skin around the edges of the patch and let it sit for a little bit... maybe about 20 - 30 seconds... pull it gently while continuing to rub oil into the edges a little at a time, repeat.  The oil dissolves the glue and also helps remove the sticky residue that shows up a day later, easier to just wipe off after being sprayed with a mist of oil than scrubbed off with soap and water.    Breakfast is all ready to eat when she wakes up- sometimes I make a high calorie, high nutrient smoothie and give it to her while she's still in bed,  put the patch on at the same time, let her snooze for 20 more minutes; PM gets high cal/high nutrient snack",8,12,1
"Daytrana","Cory Leigh","April 9, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","First, any doctor that would prescribe 30 milligram patch for a 4 year old should have his/her license removed.   My son who is 7 has never done better in school or socially until we started the patch in 1/17. It may not be for every child but it has changed our lives and I don't say that lightly.   If your insurance doesn't cover Daytrana,  you can use Good RX for better pricing as well as the manufacturer's coupon.",0,10,1
"Daytrana","Catherine Marie","March 28, 2017","-","My daughter has tried almost every ADHD drug there is.  She is a junior in high school and has a very busy schedule.  Daytrana is the only way she is able to get her homework done.  She takes the patch off an hour before she is done and off to sleep she goes.  This is the only medication that does not have harsh side effect for her.  I hate that I have to drive all over town to find a pharmacy that has it in stock.  I sure hope this shortage ends soon!",10,8,1
"Daytrana","dcsmith123","February 24, 2017","-","I was diagnosed with ADD in elementary school.  I have taken 3 different kinds of ADD medication and Daytrana has worked the best BY FAR! Strattera made me feel weird as a child.  Adderall was terrible for me! I was mean and agitated easily, got headaches a lot, just an all around bad experience for me.  I had taken Daytrana in high school and liked it, so when I went home for Christmas break from my first semester at college and told my mom I wanted back on medication  I quit taking adderal, but NEEDED something bad! I went back on Daytrana have been on it for a year and half now and I made the Athletic Presidential Honour Roll for my conference! Daytrana= miracle and a yes, for all ADD people!",10,12,1

"Daytrana","Mom of two boys","January 12, 2017","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us!",10,15,1
"Daytrana","For Jesse","December 16, 2016","-","After my 10 year tried about every medication he started Daytrana it is absolutely the miracle medication. He is in honors classes and is able tolerate his day to day routine. We put it on him before he gets up in the morning. Without the medication or on oral doses he is very unmanageable and even aggressive at times. We use Ritalin tablets when he does not have school this helps with his weight but his behavior is out of control. He really can not go to school without his patches. We need the Daytrana!!!!!!!",10,14,1

"Daytrana","Best ADHD medicine for my son","October 22, 2016","Taken for 1 to 2 years","My 8 year old son has ADHD with an anxiety disorder.  We started on Ritalin IR when he was 7 and it was great at first but his body started metabolizing them quickly.  We increased the dose and then he just became more irritable.  We tried adderall next which was awful for him.  His doctor wanted to either try Concerta or daytrana.  I asked if we could try daytrana because I had read good reviews.  This is the absolute best med we have tried.  He has been on the lowest 10 mg patch for over a year.  We put him on a prescription called Vayarin over the summer which is a natural omega 3 phosphatidylserine supplement that fixed the anxiety.  He has no issues and is like the other kids now.  Thankful for both meds that helped him!",10,16,1
"Daytrana","LizN1416","October 15, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I was first put on the daytrana patch back in 2005 my freshmen year of highschool. I have been on and off it, due to me not needing it at some times. I am 25 years old now and still only need 20 mg patches. I have not had any issues with this medication aside from the fact that some of the backings on the patches won't come off sometimes. It can leave a sticky residue on my skin but nothing that bothers me. I just restarted this back up and have noticed a decrease in appetite.but once my levels get back to normal appetite also comes back. I highly reccomend to keep communicating with your dr about any thing that feels off to you. While on this medicine my grades have always come up from d's and c's to a's and b's.",10,16,1

Her school requested for her to be put on adhd medication. Daytrana was prescribed by her doctor sense we couldn't get her to take pills.  You basically apply in on top of your ovaries if you are a girl.  Of course I asked all of the questions that a concerned parent would. Here we are ten years later and she is fifteen and flat chested and just now finally got her period. I am now wondering if she can even have children later on of course but worrying.

"Daytrana","Frustrated mommy","October 4, 2016","-","Daytrana works the best out of everything we've tried for my 10yr old son.  However, it is absolutely RIDICULOUS that this drug has been nearly impossible to find for nearly a year! Have been told for the past 6 months that the problem will be solved in the 3rd quarter of the year.  It's now October, and it's still nearly impossible to get.  Every month, I spend at least a week or more trying to track it down (yes, I use their pharmacy locator service--with mixed results.  They're staff doesn't always seem to try very hard).  They are jeopardizing patient care, for reasons that I can't fathom.  We pay $267/box out of pocket.  How hard is it to make more?",9,22,1
"Daytrana","Nervous Nellie35","August 11, 2016","-","My 9yr old daughter was on the Daytrana 10mg patch the last half of the school year. The daytrana patch did eliminate the spacing out, and she did excell in her classes the last quarter of the school year. She brought her D's and U's up to C's and B's.  I took her off the medication over the summer and now she's been back on the same 10mg Daytrana patch for 4 days. She has barely been able to eat anything. She cries because of the constant stomach pain. She's been complaining that her vision is getting blurry (which is listed as a known side effect) she has also been throwing up about once a day. I'm currently trying to work with the specialist to see if this will even out or if I should pull her off the patch ASAP.",5,13,1
"Daytrana","Chris was already taken","July 22, 2016","-","Daytrana really helped with my ADD, as it is a time release patch rather than a pill, and the pills don't usually keep me medicated long enough. I process them too fast. So the patches work great. Minimal skin irritation. However, it may have caused some kind of dependency issue. Because I now rely on the Daytrana to help me focus, I find it difficult to focus without it, to the point of being unmotivated and grumpy if I don't apply the patch. But nothing major.",9,7,1

"Daytrana","Thankful Mom","October 23, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","My daughter has ADHD and has tried every medication out there. Most did nothing but once we tried Daytrana Patches that was exactly what she needed.  Her grades improved as well as her concentration and her attitude. I am so thankful that we found the patch. She has used Daytrana for the last eight years. Even though she is 22 now, it is still a very important tool to help her focus in her last year of college. Organization, planning, study habits and everything else that goes out the window with ADHD is a new way of life and much more pleasant all the way around. Daytrana helps my daughter reach her potential and stay focused. She does have some redness from the patch but she would forget to take a pill everyday.",9,27,1
"Daytrana","AMA76","September 14, 2015","-","My son has has great results with this patch. He is 7, and on the 10 mg. He definitely has loss of appetite during the day, and it's hard to get him to sleep at a reasonable time, but he has had a complete turnaround at school. Since I know all ADHD meds have the same side effects I stated, my only real complaint is how it irritates his skin. He has taken it off several times due to itchiness (which does seem to go away after a couple hours). As for getting the backing off, I warm it between my palms for a minute or two, and peel from the pointed part of the backing. Works perfectly.",9,20,1
"Daytrana","Oaktree1987","September 8, 2015","-","Im actually an adult on the patch. I am 28. female. I've been trying to find the right stimulant with bearable side effects since I was in high school. Please excuse the lengthy review I just know the search can be tough and long. I have Depression, ADD, GA &amp; SA, and OCD skin(cuticle) picking tendencies. It's been very hard finding a stimulant that didn't worsen my anxiety related symptoms. I could tolerate 5mg adderrall XR but my body burned through both the XR and IR in about 3 hours. Then I would crash for the rest of the day (depressed, irritable, anxious).  Vyvanse gave me zero motivation and made me calm but in a weird way. For example, I didn't care or worry about anything... I didn't even want to talk to people. I would just want to sit there alone and stare at a wall or something. It was nice to be that relax but too weird. But the real problem was the crash! It was the most extreme of all the stimulants I've tried by far! I took it only twice and threw it out. I almost didn't try Daytrana patch because Ritalin was actually the first stimulant I tried, which was over 10 years ago and I remember similar symptoms to that I had on adderrall. I ended up giving it a try with the logic that it might be smoother since its was for children and I was also desperate since I'm working and study for the GRE. I'm so happy I gave Daytrana a shot!! I'm telling you if you suffer from anxiety, can't tolerate the crashes, and metabolize the other stimulant too fast you have got to try this one!! I've only been on it for a week but I can't believe it! I leave it in for the whole 9 hours and I never crash. In comparison to Adderall is still the best stimulant for getting you motivated, I have to motivate myself a little but unlike adderall I can stay focused ALL day with Daytrana. Im also less likely to do something stimulanty like start reorganizing my closet for no reason but I do get the necessary cleaning, errands, bills etc done effortlessly. And the best part is that it doubles as an anti-depressant since, what I assume is the increased dopamine stays in my system pretty much all day and night. The happiness doesn't feel like a high it feels more like an absence of depression. I don't have anymore of the repetitive negative thoughts. The constant emotions of hopelessness, guilt, embarrassment, you name it, just aren't there anymore. There is still a mild degree of sadness I carry with me but I have major depression so I feel like it's only normal and I can handle that :)!! As far as the negative side effects: Like all the stimulants I've been on I still have the insomnia, loss of appetite, and increase urge to pick at my cuticles at night when it's wearing off. But there is not a crash. no evenings being completely drained of energy, fits of irritation, major anxiety or depression.  Also, the patch is applied to your hip and I'm experiencing some muscle tension in my legs which I think might be slowly subsiding. Im drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins in precaution of cramps.  Advice on taking the patch off- It's easier for me to take it off when it's wet. I do it in the shower/bath or rub it off with a warm wash cloth.  Good luck!",9,98,2

I couldn't hangout with friends. Now it only takes me about 30 mins to an hour to finish. This patch helps me throughout the day. I only use it on weekdays when I'm at school because I only use it when I have to finish a task. But during school I find my stomach rumbling in classes. I ate breakfast every morning, and tried to eat lunch but I loose my appetite. I find myself sweating during class also from not eating in the day.",9,37,2

I stopped trying medicines and thought we would just have to deal with 3-4 hours of homework a night. In 2nd grade we heard about Daytrana. My son made a huge improvement in school.

(my doctor said that other parents had noticed that the placement of the patch makes a difference). At school he is able to control his impulses, focus and most importantly still be a 7 year old boy (not a zombie).

Negatives: if we leave the patch on from 8-6, we are up until 2 or 3 am if we do not give melatonin to help sleep.

She wears them 16 or more hours if she has a date, or there is a school function that lasts late e.g. PROM.

In reading about Daytrana, the thing I liked about it was that I knew I could cut the patch down in size (to 1/2 or 1/4) if I felt the dose was too high.  I usually am VERY sensitive to adhesives, but I've been on it about 2 weeks now and have not had a problem at all. I clean the site where the patch had been with alcohol after I take it off and have not had any skin reactions.  The product is GREAT (10 mg dose patch).",10,34,2
"Daytrana","snow1234","March 17, 2011","-","I am an adult on this medicine now for a little over a month.  I could not sleep at night because I could not get my brain to turn off  I had constant headache and horrible migraines which I am treated for by a neurologist.  My blood pressure was out of control most days over 175 with the bottom number at high 90's to 110.  Not good.  Since being on it  I have not had one migraine, my blood pressure is 120's over 60 to 70's and I can put it on and go right to sleep if I want to.  I actually sleep through the night now. I can not tell you how happy I am to feel so good.  Side effect; the patch leaves red skin that does not heel for days.  I am so excited.  My son takes Concerta now for 6 years and has good results but not like this.",9,23,2
"Daytrana","Anonymous","October 19, 2010","-","My 8 year old son has been on Daytrana for approximately 6 months and I have to say of all the ADHD medicines out there this is the best. We have tried almost every ADHD medicine out there and nothing lasted as long as it was supposed to or had no effect whatsoever. The only problem with the patch is its sticking. It never seems to stick and in the summer I had to find something waterproof to put over it.",10,21,2
"Daytrana","caseywrice","October 11, 2010","-","I just started Daytrana 30mg after being on another generic versin of methylphenidate 10mg 3 times a day and all I can say is Daytrana is the best.  I do not get the ups and downs with the pill form. Instant Release Ritalin and I also like how I do not have to keep taking pills all day long.  Daytrana is so much smoother. I was amazed at how it kept a steady supply of methylphenidate in my system.  I also believe since it slowly releases I do not feel jittery and I actually had a great appetite. The only thing I would still change is I would make the part that you peel off hard. Since it's flexible it takes a little of work to peel the back off. I can deal with it though since it the best ADD medicine I have found out there.",6,24,2
"Daytrana","jpmnfam","September 8, 2010","-","My 11 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD since kindergarten.  That is usually when parents can start to confirm their suspicions of their child's behavior with the observation of an outside party such as a teacher.  We started with the usual, very mild Strattera...to no avail.  We didn't really know what we were looking for.  We were so very sad and scared that he would become a 'zombie' as most people describe it.  Nothing worked from Strattera, Concerta (gave him tics), Clonidine (high blood pressure medicine that supposedly works for ADHD), etc. DAYTRANA 40mg has been the miracle drug for our little boy.  He has been on it for about 1 1/2 years now.  He can sit and do homework, crossword puzzles, and word finds! Absolutely love it, no more mean Morgan!",10,46,2
"Daytrana","steffers","March 26, 2010","-","My son is 10 yrs old and has ADHD. He has been on the patch for 4-5 months and the only side effects that he has is a redness where the patch was. Other than that, its a miracle patch. His grades have doubled and the lowest grade he has gotten is one C. He wears it from 5:30am-3:30pm. I love it, it calms him down and he is happy to do his homework. I can only praise this medicine. Some will give negative and positive reviews about the patch because it will effect everyone differently.",9,30,3
"Daytrana","Erin22withADHD","February 10, 2010","-","I am a 22 yr old female. Hated the significant side effects of Vyvase60mg. Hated Invuniv. Love the patch. Allows me to control the medication. I usually take it off about 7 hours after putting it on. This allows me to sleep at night. I can focus at work very well and no significant drop. I realized I cannot blow dry my hair, or go tanning with it on or I would get a big burst of medication! Sometimes have a hard time sleeping if I don't take it off early!",9,25,3
"Daytrana","Mom of 2 boys","January 23, 2010","-","Oldest son (now 11 1/2) known to us (and teachers) to have ADHD by 5 yrs of age. Did not want him on medicines, but by 2nd grade, he was not able to work to his potential. Tried Focalin. Made my sweet, funny child nauseous and zombie like. We both cried every morning while he took it. Tried for 2 months, said forget it, not worth it. Next 4 years - no medicines at all, just great teachers and A LOT of work to keep his grades/other issues with ADD on track as best we could. EXTREMELY difficult especially for him to maintain/not stay stressed out at school/doing homework/projects/sports. Middle school began this year. Too much to handle without something. Began DAYTRANA-10 mg at Xmas. Works wonders for him! No side effects except less appetite!",9,43,3
"Daytrana","Anonymous","December 3, 2009","-","My teenager daughter was recently diagnosed with ADHD to no surprise to anyone.  She managed well until high school and was then put on Daytrana. she has experienced no side effects except decrease in appetite and if she keeps the patch on too long she might have difficulty falling asleep.  Her focus has improved substantially and she is able to do her school work.  However as everyone knows this medication only solves one piece of the puzzle.  Overall she does not seem to have the rebound issues that people have with the medications taken by mouth.",9,9,3
"Daytrana","Anonymous","October 30, 2009","-","This is our second month on Daytrana for my 5 year old, who used to have many problems in school: getting into trouble, not sitting, hitting other kids, etc... It takes about 2 hrs to kick in but what a difference. He is evenly calm and listens, no violent outbursts or being hateful. He was on Focalin XR for 9 mos. too much trouble with capsules, had to grind beads and put in his drinks to drink. Having trouble at school to take second dose, he refused. Don't like red skin irritations, putting baby oil, lotion, and Neosporin as it is itchy and he scratches, breaking skin. Easy to put on at 6 am while he is still sleeping so it can kick in by 8 am when school starts. Wonderful!",10,34,3
"Daytrana","Big Cheese","October 6, 2009","-","Used this for recently diagnosed adult ADD (no hyper-activity). What a difference it made. Started at 30mg, finished at 40mg (30mg plus 10mg patch). I finally finished my last class for a long overdue college degree and my family relationship has improved because I am able to stay on task, keep commitments and be focused and present when with other people. I loved putting it on and forgetting it until my alarm reminded me to remove it late in the day. Unfortunately, the skin itching and rashes got to be severe perhaps because I wore the patch from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm. I went off the patch and still had red marks,  and raised bumps weeks later. I'm switching to Vyvanse next month.",8,9,3
"Daytrana","Eevee-San","October 5, 2009","-","This patch was not very useful to me. All it did was irritate my skin and cause a huge loss in appetite. While on this, however, I lost no weight.",3,1,3
"Daytrana","Mom in MI","September 14, 2009","-","My daughter was on the Daytrana patch for 2 years and did very well during most of that time. Daytrana was a breath of fresh air. She was still a normal child with high spirits.  She did well in school and maintained friendships.  My complaints about the Daytrana patch was the skin irritation.  Her skin reddened and eventually scarred. It would take at least 2 hours in the morning to kick-in which was hell for her homeroom and 1st hr teachers. 2 hours after removal she was EXTREMELY hyperactive. Days without the patch were agonizing at best because her behavior was so over the top. She also did not eat while the patch was on. However, the benefits outweighed the negatives for me.",9,30,3
"Daytrana","Anonymous","August 25, 2009","-","Love the results we're getting, but now we have side effects - severe side effects.  Just found out by coming to this site that it can cause seizures, which is what we are going through now.  My son had a seizure last night, but the ER doctor told us that there's been no reports of it causing seizures...hmmm...interesting.",7,5,3
"Daytrana","Anonymous","July 14, 2009","-","My son has autism, ocd and adhd.  This medication has made a tremendous difference!  Before Daytrana, he was taking timed release Focalin xr capsules. We had to empty the capsules into a spoon for him to swallow with water because he cannot swallow pills.  We also tried the liquid compounded form.  Both forms were short acting because he couldn't swallow the capsule so he had to take it 3 times per day. Because he was not getting a steady, controlled dose, he was not as focused as he is now with the Daytrana. He also had sleep difficulty for two years while taking Focalin. Not any longer! He can focus, eat and sleep. He does have red skin underneath the patch which disappears after removal.",10,15,3
"Daytrana","Anonymous","July 8, 2009","-","My son has been on several different ADHD medications.  He had been on one for a couple years and it wasn't having the effect it should after so long, so they changed him to Daytrana.  He was so out of control on this medication.  It actually seemed to make his impulse issues and attention worse. We discontinued the patch after the 2nd week.  Hopefully it's positive for others, just definitely not the one for my son.",2,13,3
"Daytrana","matt's mom","May 7, 2009","-","We love the patch. The results with Daytrana are amazing. He still eats before applying and after taking off, his personality hasn't changed, just his behavior. The only negative thing I can say is the red mark the patch leaves after you take it off, my son always says it itches.",10,32,3
"Daytrana","MS adhd MOM","April 28, 2009","-","My 6 year old daughter was put on Daytrana about 8 months after trying Vyvanse and Strattera without success. We had immediate results. She was focused and even her handwriting improved. The patch did leave a red mark that I found Eucerin cream was good for. Here is the but: She developed a tic.  Don't let this discourage you. I know of others on Daytrana who have been taking it for over a year with no tics. It really worked great.",9,22,3
"Daytrana","BandBMama","November 29, 2008","-","I use Daytrana for Adult ADHD. Unlike most other ADHD medicines (except maybe Vyvanse), it is very smooth, meaning there is no crash at the end of the day, or big jolt in the morning.  I just feel very calm and I can concentrate much better and it's the best ADD medicine I've tried. I take 30mgs and keep it on 12-16 hours. A few things in reference to other raters. Some doctors allow the patch to be on for 24 hours.  That would help with the child that had problems in the evening (something to ask your doctor about). The patch was originally designed for 24 hours (so there is enough medicine in the patch to wear it that long), but during clinical trials, there were skin issues hence the 9 hour limit.",10,49,3

He became focused, talks less to imaginary friends and is actually learning in school. I was terrified to start him on drugs but it came down to what was important my fear of drugs or his well being. The patch works well for him, no side effects observed and hopefully we keep him on the lowest dose available.",8,38,3

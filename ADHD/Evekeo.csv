"Evekeo","SymptomSavant","October 31, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","For my limited purposes, Evekeo has worked great. I use it as a booster dose late in the day. The difference between this med and Adderall is that Evekeo is 50/50 d- and l-amphetamine, whereas Adderall is 75% d/25% l. Theoretically, that change to 50/50 should decrease the  high  dopamine feeling mg-for-mg and increase norepinephrine release which could increase cardiovascular side effects. But for me, I only take 10 mg, so it’s like a cup of coffee with better focus late in the day. At higher doses, maybe Adderall would be better, but as a booster, I find Evekeo to be effective and free of any significant side effects.",10,2,1
"Evekeo","Mcnulty","August 16, 2019","-","Was prescribed concerta, Adderall, strattera, and vyvanse. All worked for a bit and ceased to work and gave me awful side effects. At least with evekeo and the generic kind, I have control of dosing and it’s always persistent.",10,3,1
"Evekeo","Dixiegirl","August 7, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","After both ritalin and adderall aggravate my anxiety and caused my heart to race, my doctor suggested evekeo. It did not cause my heart to race, but I was only on 5mg and it did not help my symptoms. My doctor upped me to 10mg, but I was unable to afford it even with the copay card because I don't have very good insurance. I'm trying to find a way to afford it because it was so great to find an ADHD med that didn't cause my heart to race like others.",0,4,1
"Evekeo","Dina","June 6, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Having a high metabolism, my medications wear off very quickly. Dr and I talked about trying Evekeo but decided to try adding one more dose of Adderall XR to the mix. When that didn’t help, tried Evekeo and discountinued the  Adderal XR but kept the afternoon doses of IR. As for Evekeo,  I had a very bad reaction to it. My face broke out and not pimples but sores that are now going to scar My depression (which I haven’t had in awhile due to consistency of taking medication) was three times worse, I went to  a very dark place, I went days without sleeping, no motivation or drive to do anything, very irritable, very mean, not social at all, terrible intrusive thinking, pushed away anyone that was close to me, no appetite at all, headaches, muscle soreness and vomiting/diarrhea. Thankfully we stopped the medication, but I don’t want to feel like this ever again!",1,5,1
"Evekeo","Beck","April 27, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was switched from Adderall 20mg tablets that I was taking PRN so not every day to the Evekeo. I asked to try something else because the Adderall would wear off quickly and I felt like I needed to take several pills back to back. I'm not a fan of taking meds in the first place so this was a problem for me. My doc made the switch to Evekeo 10mg once a day but advised me to taper myself until I felt it working. I'm in healthcare so no problem tapering and keeping track. Being that it was new to me I started by taking 2.5mg and tapering up over the span of several days. I didn't feel a single thing all the way up to when I finally tapered to 20mg all at once. The only things I think I felt from it was paranoia/anxiety (that seemed to come out of nowhere) and craving beer... I hate beer! During this trial my productivity and focus tanked. I waited a day and took one of my old adderall and it worked like a charm. In conclusion, I can't say this is bad for everybody but it's definitely not for me.",1,6,1
"Evekeo","Paris","January 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've tried several ADHD meds and this is hands down the best. No side effects at all. There is finally a generic, so please ask your doctor to try this. Can get as cheap as $18 compared to $632",10,10,1
"Evekeo","Vincent Vega","January 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","33 year old male. I have been off and on stimulants my whole life. I take lamictal, Cymbalta, Xanax and Evekeo.  Evekeo has been an excellent medication for me and it just went generic which is a huge plus. I don't get the tunnel vision that adderall gave me, or the extremely anxious and depressed feelings I got from Adderall. Ritalin made my body, even my bones ache. I felt like I had the flu and it actually made me less effective. Vyvanse made my blood pressure extremely high and I felt like I metabolized the dose extremely fast. I felt somewhat manic on the medication. I take 30 mg of Evekeo 10, 3x per day.",9,9,1
"Evekeo","adhdgirl","November 28, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Vyvanse gave me a dependency to it and after a while stopped working as well and the insomnia, irritability, worsened. Then insurance stopped covering it, switched to Adderall and loved it for a while because its made me feel high. My mom thought it made me irritable and made me switch. I love Evekeo now because of the control I have with when and how much I take. No side effects so far! Also can tell I am thinking more before I speak and don't feel like an addict.",9,12,1
"Evekeo","Mel W","October 3, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","My doctor suggested switching me from 70mg of Vyvanse to 10mg of Evekeo (2x per day) to see if that eliminated the insomnia issue I was having with Vyvanse. After a week on Evekeo, I'd go back to Vyvanse in a heartbeat. I've been taking stimulant medication for ADD for almost 30 years, and I have never had one be utterly ineffective at helping me focus. With Evekeo, it's like I took nothing at all. Zero ability to focus. To make matters worse, I'm experiencing 6 of the main side effects, one of which is a raging headache that sticks around all day (and feels like a migraine when the med first kicks in). It makes me feel very wired and shaky, too. I just called my doctor and asked to be squeezed in ASAP so I can switch to something else (might go back to Adderall), as I cannot keep taking Evekeo for another 20+ days.",2,6,1
"Evekeo","Concerned mama","April 29, 2018","-","We switched from vyvance in the morning and focolin in the afternoon because the cost was getting way to expensive for both and insurance wasn't allowing us to get name brand so we could use a copay card.  After switching to eveko my 11 year old son started having major anger and frustration problems in school.  His teachers said it worked well the first couple days for his focusing but then it was like he wasn't on it at all.  He started becoming extremely defiant in school, hitting himself in the face because he was mad and frustrated.  Calming him down was next to impossible.  We were getting calls on a daily basis.  Not sure how we will do it but we are more than likely going back to his previous medication.",1,9,1
"Evekeo","Senior in High School","April 2, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","After Adderal and Ritalin made me incredibly irritable, moody, and anxious I tried evekeo and it is my miracle drug! I've been on it for 2 years now and have no complaints. I recommend this drug if you have failed the more popular stimulants! 11/10 recomend!!",10,22,1
"Evekeo","Truth76","January 28, 2018","-","Had bad experience. Very bad anxiety and depression side effects don’t try!",2,5,1
"Evekeo","Anonymous","November 22, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Tried all these different medicines and found vyvanse XR worked perfect Until insurance didn’t cover it anymore so I took Concerta and that basically made my heart rate go up to 170 BPM and it was ridiculous so I tried a newer medication evekeo and it’s good but causes a hell of a withdrawal including anger  diarrhea dizziness nausea loss of appetite but for the most part it’s good",6,9,1
"Evekeo","Concerened Mom","October 10, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","My child has been on this almost a week and it has made her worse in school and hyper, I am looking forward to seeing the Doctor this week, the dose was cut in half after being on it 1 day and no change in behaviour, still not able to focus and refuses all school work and became more defiant.",8,11,1
"Evekeo","Junkie Jack","June 6, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","Love this med to help me stay awake to study.",10,6,1
"Evekeo","Lulu1988","February 4, 2017","-","I have bipolar I disorder with psychotic and depressive features and a diagnosis of ADHD. I take meds for all three conditions. I take Vyvanse 50mg in the AM. When that wares off, I take Evekeo 10 mg twice every 4-5 hours, PM. I also take my stimulants with Ativan as I also have anxiety too. Evekeo is perfect for me. It doesn't make me feel hyper nor does it give me that 'high' feeling. It normalizes me and I can actually be driven and calm at the same time. Since I take two stimulants, you're probably wondering how in the world. All I can say is that Vyvanse doesn't last all day long for me, so I supplement with Evekeo. I take Evekeo once Vyvanse wares out. I'm happy with them both.",9,25,1
"Evekeo","sarahisabel98","December 28, 2016","-","18 year old college female. I've been medicated for 4 years now and tried concerta (which was hell) and Vyvanse (the devils drug). Evekeo was amazing at first kind of similar to Vyvanse and then it went downhill. Whereas on Vyvanse I just wouldn't eat and was depressed and spacey, this one didn't have side effects like that. But after awhile it made me incredibly mean, and didn't seem to take away the verbal impulse side of the hyperactivity. I'm normally an incredibly happy person but when I'm on this medicine I'm a bitch to whoever over whatever for no reason at all. It did help with the focusing though.",6,18,1
"Evekeo","Help mom in need","December 18, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My childs grades have suffered more after beginning evekeo and his behavior is so much worse than before. I honestly cannot wait to to see the Dr. again.",2,7,1
"Evekeo","Calstudent","October 12, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","The only ADHD medication I have taken that doesn't have awful side effects. It makes you more alert and productive with out the headaches and and hungover feeling that I get with adderall and focalin. I don't think it effects everyone the same but it has been a real lifesaver for me.",9,22,1
"Evekeo","GingerBreadMike","September 28, 2016","-","I enjoyed Evekeo.  It was great when it came to improving focus.  I also have shift work disorder so for me stimulants are great as they help me overcome the hump I hit every morning when I just want to go to bed and sleep all day.  My wife complained that I was getting really hard to live with compared to normal.  I knew I was more irritable than normal.  Over the 5 months I took it I did feel like the level of irritabilty and arguementativeness was steadily increasing.  Stopped taking when my wife told me I was starting to become unbearable.   I usually get 2 migraines a year but while on evekeo I had 3 in 5 months.",8,14,1
"Evekeo","Sky85","August 19, 2016","-","This medicine was horrible for me. I started off at a low dose. It gave me horrible anxiety, mood swings and horrifying negative thoughts. I would never take this medicine again.",1,14,1
"Evekeo","NotSoHyper","August 7, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","Evekeo made me feel like I had the flu. I felt like I had stayed up until 5am drinking tequila. I had had no alcohol at all. My muscles ached, I was exhausted, I felt like I was going to puke, and I could barely move. I went back to Vyvanse after 2 days. It ends too early for me, but doesn't make me miserable.",3,10,1
"Evekeo","allthenicknamesareinuse","July 30, 2016","-","20 y/o college female. Keeps me alert, focused, awake. I usually wait a little bit after taking it to have caffeine, not necessary just personal preference based on how it makes me feel. Switched to it after taking vyvanse for almost a year, which was great but it eventually made me irritable. so far i have loved this medication. no side effects, but if you take a dose too late in the day it will keep you up at night. i take 5mg in the morning and then another dose when i really need to focus. shorter release so i feel like i need a nap after 4-5 hours. overall would recommend.",8,17,1
"Evekeo","MauraJ","June 23, 2016","-","Eh, it's better than adderall but vyvanse is still a lot smoother. Gave me horrible indigestion and heart burn as well as extreme anxiety and chest pain.",6,13,1
"Evekeo","Kimmy82013","April 27, 2016","-","Evekeo has been great for the first Time I am doing a lot better in my school and I understand it better. When it comes off its smooth and I don't stay up all night . I use the discount for my prescription and my insurance card and it is not that expensive. But without all of that it definitely will be",9,15,1
"Evekeo","IanKov","March 24, 2016","-","Much better than vyvanse. A lot smooth and MUCH more consistent.",10,12,2
"Evekeo","Ghawk","December 18, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have to say I thought it would be like Adderall but it's really not. I read their study, yeah I'm a dork, but I remembering it saying different mixtures working different. If you are having problems with your current ADHD med talk to you doctor and get a 60 pill free trial.",9,28,2
"Evekeo","Moke","December 9, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Evekeo works great. It's more mild in regards to excitability in comparison to adderall.  Evekeo is Amphetamine Sulfate and carries 50% dextroamphetamine and 50% levoamphetamine.  Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, so Evekeo is much smoother and wears off slowly vs adderall's fluctuating tapering.  It is much different than adderall.  Evekeo doesn't make you feel wired like adderall does.  It's a cleaner medicine.  Evekeo is a freebase Amphetamine while adderall has 4 different salts.  I would recommend the makers of Evekeo to make higher milligram tablets.  It's similar to a 10mg adderall IR.  It's just the ratio of ingredients that's the difference. Duration is said by pharmacists to be 12 hr's, buts more like 6.",8,41,2
"Evekeo","AlphaDog1","November 18, 2015","-","Better than Adderall or Vyvanse for side effects.  Works the same but not as long",8,20,2
"Evekeo","Jenny85","October 29, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","So far so good. Helps with ADHD but less side effects .. Gonna keep using it",10,15,2
"Evekeo","wwwangel","September 21, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My son's doctor gave him this to try. It's pretty much the same as Adderall. I didn't see a big difference in his behavior compared to generic Adderall. There's not much point in paying a premium price (no generic) for the same effectiveness as his usual med.",7,11,2

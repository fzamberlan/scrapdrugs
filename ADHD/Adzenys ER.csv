"Adzenys ER","Ape","September 27, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","Have been on adderall for years and so a while back l had a  drug test which is fine I'm on suboxone so l drug test monthly anyway. 3 months ago my psych dr said l tested positive for cocaine which was never anything l did. I also offered to sign a release so she get my records from my suboxone dr so she would know.  Never ever in 10 to 13 years have l tested dirty for cocaine so why would l now. She said she wasn't interested. My blood pressure has dropped dangerously low and the adderall raise it so l need back on it. What should l do?",0,0,1

"Adderall XR","John","May 3, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted. Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.",8,7,1

"Adderall XR","Theophilus","March 18, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen",8,17,1

Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.",6,11,1

I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.",10,9,1

This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it.

I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog.

With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!",9,15,1

I switched to Adderall XR and I was immediately able to concentrate and focus, I was not confused anymore either. I am on 25mg now but I think 30mg may work just a little bit better, overall Adderall XR is the best thing I've ever taken for my ADHD!

I had issues with not being able to focus, total attention deficit, anxiety, zero motivation, sleeping all the time, forgetting to use planner, messy house, no organization. Imagine being stuck inside the deepest fog within yourself and not being able to see clearly.  I hated the way I felt. Enter Adderall... started out on 10mg XR adjusted to 30mg XR. Side effects: mild headache at back of head, weight loss and thirst. Head ache went away, fog dissipated, as well as the fatigue, messy house, anxiety  and attention disorder. I am able to focus, I tackle one thing at a time, I can prioritize, I can get up in the morning and not dread the day ahead of me. I smile a little more, laugh a little more, procrastinate less. I am able to give my children more of the attention they deserve.

I'm going to a psychiatrist for a further notice but I can say it helps me a lot but when the pill gets out of the system you feel some what down and frustrated. But once it kicks in you're on your feet not depressed and doing things around the house etc. But the down side is the foods you intake  I feel like any vit c kills the drug. And it's bad that your body needs vit c like Apple's etc, but in the long run of 10/10 this is a great drug for people with ADHD and ADD also sleeping a lot.",10,20,1

My new psychiatrist switched me to XR after my GP had me on IR which caused raised BP and anxiety. Adderall XR has given me back control over my life. I am no longer struggling to complete tasks, have endless patience, have become more naturally social and less avoidant of people. I no longer get overwhelmed at the thought of having to do something. I am much less impulsive, especially financially, as I got into $17k of debt and am finally organizing my life to pay it off. The only negative is that it is addictive. Before adding Celexa, I had a difficult time weaning off and taking tolerance breaks. I would go through severe withdrawals and depression. Celexa has helped me lower my dose and allows me to take breaks without feeling like I am going to die.  Overall a good medication when responsible monitored and taken.

Once I progress towards the sixth month problems slowly started coming up and day by day you fall back into where you started, if you keep going you'll get even worse.

"Adderall XR","aloomis85419","June 21, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This drug provides great concentration for a couple hours. However, after a couple hours I predictably experience extreme anxiety, depression, and irritability. It can easily cause you to get into an argument with someone you love because you are so easily irritated and frustrated by anything. The anxiety is the worst. Being a previous smoker, Adderall increases my craving to smoke by ten fold (a habit I have quit and hardly have cravings for anymore). I also find that the drug clouds my ability to think when doing brain intensive work such as programming, math, or even typing. I think that might be related to the dosage though. I don't recommend this medication to anyone (other than those with severe ADHD).",3,14,2

AdultADHD","May 2, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Mine may be a somewhat rarer case of ADHD, that is very severe, and my response to amphetamines is almost perfectly paradoxical for the best known effects.  I sleep better and longer with significant blood concentration (it's neutral for going to sleep, but keeps me asleep longer), have better appetite, cannot achieve euphoria or a high from amphetamines, only a mild feeling of extra energy. For me adderall is far less effective than single ingredient D-isomer formulations.  Best guess is that the L-isomer is what ruins it for my condition or perhaps the more exotic salts.  Vyvanse, Desoxyn, Dexedrine are much more effective and without side-effects for me.  Didn't expect the difference, but adderall doesn't work well with my brain chem.",4,25,2

I gave it a 10 based on it's effectiveness for ADHD, but factoring in the aggravation this medicine causes to tics, I would give a 5/10.

I've been on the xr for 3 days now. I can't say much for it being consistently effective though, it's also much more subtle as far as focus/concentration goes, and it seems to wear off much sooner than its supposed to, though it's hard to tell.

Now, each day I take it, i feel very intelligent and concentrated, and come up with ideas easily, as well as feeling great all of the time.

I also feel that it helps me with connecting to others.

About an hour after I took my dose of 20mgs I started to feel this awake, alert, energetic feeling inside. I liked, a lot. For the next 5 hours all of my boring subjects became very interesting and I became a very social person. After about a month, those effects started to go away.

After taking Adderall my sales numbers are stellar, and I feel like I can go back to college again.

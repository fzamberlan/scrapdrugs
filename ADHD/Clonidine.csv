"Clonidine","Chris","January 29, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I started taking clonidine just over 1 year ago after my anxiety, impulsivity and ADHD was getting out of hand. I also wanted to stop my stimulants because they didn't improve my quality of life like my neurologist kept telling me they would. My PCP recommended Clonidine. It really helps me relax and focus within about 30-40 minutes. I take 1 or 1.5 pills during the day when feeling anxious or overwhelmed and it really helps me relax, focus, and better control my thoughts. If I take 2 during the day, I get too sleepy. I do take 2 before bed and it helps me sleep really well. I really enjoy this medication, especially because it doesn't have addictive qualities. I'd definitely recommend this to others. Worst side effect was dry mouth that went away after the first few months. This med changed my life and is so simple.",9,12,1

"Clonidine","NTG898","December 7, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Trying this med for numerous reasons. Works for blood pressure but pulse jumps up over 100 at rest. Possibly due to using Diovan (valsartan) as well. Prescribed by psychiatrist to counteract effects from hypertension from taking add meds. BTW, clonidine is prescribed for children, but will lower blood pressure. Be careful if you do have low blood pressure. But give it a try for a week or at least speak with your doctor if you have other symptoms.",7,8,1

"Clonidine","orangetoday","May 25, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","This review is more frustration with my doctors than this drug. I was diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD over a year ago, although I've had it for my entire life. Because my heart rate was high, I was initially put on Strattera. Didn't work, massive headaches, gross night sweats. Gave up for a while. Finally got a new doctor and she puts me on Catapres because it helps with anxiety (which I have bundles of) and prescribing a stimulant would lead to questions about her qualifications (seriously tho). Taking it at night with my Trazodone does help put me to sleep, but has long-lasting lethargic effects during the day that end up causing ironic panic attacks at work because I hate feeling sedated when I need to be alert.

"Clonidine","Mom of PANS Kid","November 29, 2016","-","My 11-year-old son has been diagnosed with PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome).. Clonidine is so effective with my son that we only give him 1/8 of his pill. If I give him 1/4 he is very tired in the morning. He is also on a very small dose of Prozac. He takes Clonidne as needed for anxiety as the Zithromax (antibiotics) got rid of his tics so he doesn't need the Clonidine anymore for that. But sometimes his anxiety acts up at night and Clonidine relaxes him so he can sleep. He also has 1/2 a 3mg of melatonin but he can only take melatonin now that his tics are gone because before it made him tired while he was wired and that was uncomfortable.  Anyway, Clonidine is the best medication for his anxiety, but if we give him the diagnosed amount he is a zombie in the morning",10,26,1

All I can say is that I am really disappointed with Strattera... I fought and fought to get a stimulant to no avail and they finally gave me Kapvay for bedtime. It's been two weeks and my depression has finally lifted because my inattention and distraction is gone. They are symbiotic with each other.

I have the same energy and personality as my old self with ADHD off of vyvanse, but compared to not taking stimulants without clonidine as compared to not taking stimulants with clonidine, I feel like I can finally live without a prescription narcotic and be successful.

It never made a meaningful dent in his ability to concentrate or sit still, and he became more argumentative in school and less willing to comply. I've yet to meet anyone that these work for, but it sure would be nice if there were a non-stimulant that worked. We're on stimulants now and still haven't found a miracle there, either.

"Cotempla XR-ODT","Anna Rock","August 31, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My 7 years old son started Cotempla to treat his ADHD after 3 years on non stimulant medication. The product has not work for him at all.  After 2 hours he is very tired and feel sleepy then after 6 hours when the product comes off his system, he become very hyperactive, impulsive with a sudden burst of energy. And this last hours. He has difficulty to fall asleep, his appetite is massively reduced. We will have to stop this medication and find something else that works better for him.",1,1,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","Ash","July 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My 9 yr old started this 3 days ago after outgrowing his previous medication for ADHD. It was not a good option for him and had to be stopped. His blood pressure dropped significantly, he had headaches, tremors, vomiting, stomach pains, and drowsiness. This was tried 30min before meals, then the next day 30min after a meal. Symptoms started within 1 hour of taking the medication. We are 24 hours off it and he’s still dizzy and nauseated. So it’s been 4 days of misery for him.",1,2,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","Gleam76","October 7, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I’ve been on cotempla 25.9mg for ADD for a year and a half and overall it works quite well, however I have had continual issues with it not working quickly or very well when taking it with or after a meal. However after talking to my doc, I found out that taking it about half an hour before eating breakfast (drinking coffee/other drinks is fine) solves most of the efficacy issues because of the IR portion of the tablet (25%) can be easily  lost  into the food and not absorbed quickly. Although this is somewhat inconvenient, it helps me get the most out of the Cotempla. Overall it is very effective, but the IR/XR formulation could be improved.",7,8,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","Seph","July 12, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","(While I did have ADHD as a child, I don't anymore as an adult. However, my Major Depressive Disorder and complex form of PTSD both cause issues with focus; so I continue to be prescribed stimulants into adulthood.)  I have been taking Cotempla for a couple days now. I had to switch from Daytrana because of stock/back order issues. I can say that I find it effective. I'm prescribed two 17.3 mg tablets a day. I take one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. I find that they last a decent amount of time (even though some medicine tends to just 'go right through me'). They taste fine and I think that they absorb better for me due to lack of a pill casing. If you're having issues with XR medicine like Focalin, Vyvanse, or other capsule pills, Cotempla may be a good option. Please note that I did not pay for my first 30 days of the medicine, I got it as a free trial, but will likely continue it after the month is over.",9,2,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","Lauren M.","May 9, 2018","-","My 8 yr old son has been taking this medication for a week now and it’s only lasting six hours. He takes 2 pills of 17.3 mg every morning and it lasts until about 3 o’clock. My biggest complaint is that when you comes off of it he is incredibly hyperactive and impulsive. Much more so than if he didn’t take any medication at all. The effect of the medication when it is exiting his system is not smooth. He comes off the medication after six hours with a sudden burst of energy. Was hoping for a smooth transition when the medication wears off. Concerta gave him a much smoother transition exiting his body but didn’t last as long as the Cotempla.",5,10,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","Akdsj114","April 7, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I switched to cotempla from Vyvanse due to tolerance issues, and I think the cotempla works much better for my ADD. It kicks in in about 20 minutes, the tablets taste fine, and it stays effective for about 9 hours after I take it. It also had less of the amphetamine side effects like jitters, anxiety, and elevated heart rate. My only complaint is that they only make 25.9mg tablets as the max dosage, so I have to take two a day, but in my opinion it is much more effective for ADD than Vyvanse and adderall.",9,6,1
"Cotempla XR-ODT","lauren","March 6, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Used this medicine in replacement for quillivant XR when it was on back order. The pills don't dissolve as fast as I expected them to. They still dissolve pretty fast and taste good. Works good with concentration and doesn't suppress your appetite as much.",10,7,1

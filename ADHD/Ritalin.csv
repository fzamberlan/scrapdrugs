"Ritalin","Old(ish) Fella","March 1, 2020","-","I'm 56 year old male. 87kg. Recently diagnosed ADHD as Im easily distracted &amp; can't concentrate easily. I'm in good health, and successful &amp; don't get depressed. Unfortunately Ritalin has NO effect on me at all. I have no feeling of it coming on or wearing off. All I get is a dry mouth at higher doses. I began fast release 10mg @ 8am &amp; 10mg @ 1pm.  The upped to 20mg am &amp; 20 mg pm. Then 30 &amp; 30. Nothing. No affect or change in how I feel. Then tried Slow release SR 40 mg am &amp; 40mg arvo. Still nothing. Then tried 20mg Fast with 40mg SR in morning. But was distracted on phone &amp; mistakenly took same dose 15 min later. So 120mg in one hit. I expected to have heart racing &amp; some sort of 'buzz', but NOTHING Very disappointing Would like to try Adderall or similar",1,7,1
"Ritalin","M. Y.","February 6, 2020","-","I'm 24 y.o male that self diagnosed ADHD about 6 months ago. From as far back as I remember I was restless, inattentive, depressed and forgetful but I didn't know that what was wrong with me. I thought that everybody has a unique behaviour and mind and so this unusual type is mine and I should control it by myself! From childhood I was the kid who study hard but gained little, who is forgetful, who is weak in math! Who is lazy. Anyway, now I'm medical student and I found that I have ADD after a long story.  I told this to my attending physician and he confirmed that I have ADD, then prescribed ritalin 10mg per day and increased that to the dose 10mg ×3 a day. The best word I can tell you about Ritalin for ADD patients is Miracle. Now for the first time in my life I understand the meaning of being calm, being happy, being focused, being organized and many other good 'Being's'. It was a huge change in my life and I'm happy for that. The side effects for me was very mild and gone with the time and I want to continue it.",9,40,1
"Ritalin","Ali","January 23, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I'm a 20-year-old woman, 179 cm and 61 kg, who just got diagnosed with ADD for the first time in my life, after living with it untreated for so many years. So, my doctor wanted to prescribe me with Ritalin, though in a small doses, so I didn't just go all in from the start. I started with 10mg, which didn't have an affect. Then I took 20mg, I felt a little more energized but nothing else. Then I tried 30mg today. I felt extremely fresh in my mind, instead of the weird slump I'm usually in. Very happy, which suggests that what I lacked before was dopamine. Still no difference with anything else, like my poor concentration and focus, but on the other side there is no side effects as of late. Other than the things, that I've already struggle with, like depression and anxiety. Not a bad experience thus far, but I'm still a little bit nervous, about how 40mg and 50mg will affect me.",7,7,1
"Ritalin","Sherie","December 22, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","30, female, ADD, 95 lbs. Just to share what I have experienced for starting on Ritalin (5mg) today for the very first time. I did not feel anything on the first pill (at 1:10pm) and I took the second one around 7 hours later (around 7:50pm). The second one kicked in around 2 hours later. I was alert and could stay patient at one task before jumping onto the next one. I also felt talkative so I responded a couple of emails efficiently ( it usually takes me a while to draft an email) and got on the social media to greet friends (I do not chat on social media much I am never good at keeping in touch with people.) It was until 4am and I felt my body needed rest but my brain was still alert. I put myself to sleep but then I woke up with a fast heart rate just 1 hour and 10 min later. At this moment, I finally feel it is wearing off as I am typing. I know this because has taken me 20 min so far to write this comment - I am reverting to the attention-deficient and anxious myself.",7,15,1

"Ritalin","eleven","November 13, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","22, Male, ADD, Anxiety-disorder  Ritalin (Methylphenidate) is amazing. However, there's a catch: - it enhances focus but does not direct your focus towards a subject that you're not interested in - I experience extreme euphoria/confidence/optimism for about 1 hour (it builds up gradually, peaking at 2 hour mark with 10mg  - if you use this daily, tolerance builds up quickly after every 2 weeks (for me) -when I stop taking it I feel depressed for days but it will wear off as naturally occurring chemicals reach equilibrium again I suggest cycling it according to your productive days:  - 3/4 days a week and the rest off (avoiding tolerance and dependence) - it enhances your CURRENT focus, so start working/studying for 15/30 min THEN take it (I've researched the most irrelevant topics which excite me the most for hours, only to find that within 30 min the Ritalin's effects are going to wear off)",7,21,1
"Ritalin","ADHD Gal","November 13, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started Ritalin 10 mg 3 times daily yesterday as I have ADHD. I feel calmer and less anxious, but it is not a huge difference. I also seem to be in a more positive mood, and getting myself motivated to do things seems easier, but that could just be the placebo effect at work. First thing I did when the first dose kicked in was have a nap, so it must be calming me down. I expected my tourettes or anxiety to get worse, but I haven't noticed any side effects so far.",7,9,1

My pyschiatrist told me to take it everyday. The last couple days I've been on 40mg a day and it doesn't do anything for me anymore, maybe my tolerance is high and I shouldn't be taking it everyday. But I'm still figuring out what works for me, I find I am quite resistant to most drugs like I need more than most people but I only weigh 40kg so I'm a little disappointed at the moment but I think it might just be a tolerance thing and maybe I should only take it when I need it like for university.",4,4,1

I have dabbled with other drugs in the past, like cannabis, LSD, mushrooms and morphine. I took ritalin for two days before deciding to quit. Never in my entire life have I ever felt this level of addiction, nor have I ever crashed this bad on any drug. I have suffered with severe depression, OCD and anxiety for some years. The crash gave me a rebound to my past psychosis.",1,13,1

This drug has completely turned me around.  20mg in the morning, 10 mg in the afternoon.  When on it, I don't feel high, just alive.  I'm awake, alert, focused and most importantly out of my shell.  I don't dread work, I welcome it, I hunger for tasks.  I almost immediately go from insecure introvert to confident extrovert.  Unfortunately, it's very difficult to function now without it.  I refuse to abuse it so I am very strict with my 30mg per day.  When it wears off, I completely revert back to my old self.",8,49,1

I am on 20mg 3 times a day, I have found that Ritalin works the best for me on staying focused and keeping my head together and not all over the place. It's not a 100% cure all but I can tell a difference for the good. The only bad experience I had was when I ran out and didn't have them for 3 days and it caused me to go through withdrawal. That wasn't a pleasant experience so I make sure I fill them on time and take them like I'm supposed to.",8,28,1

Turned to alcohol before getting diagnosed as this would help me deal with constantly being wired for sound! Unfortunately this also caused my liver enzymes to go out of whack.

I have had ADHD my whole life and started taking this medication to help get my life in order and to help get all of my thoughts together. This pill is amazing for organization and for getting tasks done that need to be completed. I have no complaints with this medications regarding how effective it was at treating my ADHD and increasing my focus. The reason that I scored this medication on the lower spectrum is because when I was taking this medicine I would get severe headaches. The headaches would happen 30 minutes into taking the medication. The headaches were not ordinary headaches. It felt as if I was going to have a brain aneurysm. Highly recommend this medication to people that do not experience severe headaches while taking it.",5,17,1
"Ritalin","Jadey","June 28, 2019","-","First off, it was horrible for me. I will never go back to Ritalin ever again.  I was on 10mg of Ritalin and it lasted around 2 hours. It was the weirdest experience. I felt simultaneously euphoric, jittery and stimulated, but also lazy and just wanted to sleep (???). It did give me a strong boost of energy which lasted throughout the day. After 2 hours was when things got really bad. I guess this is the 'crash'. It made me horribly depressed, anxious, and filled with rage. The anxiety was so bad that every single thing I set eyes on would trigger me, like looking at the laundry basket filled with laundry.  I also felt extremely anti-social and didn't want to talk to anyone, not even my husband. Finally towards the end of the night I would return to my normal self again, but you can imagine the emotional roller-coaster I experienced the entire day. I tried to brush it off and chalked it down to stress. But looking back now, I am 100% certain that it was all due to the Ritalin.",1,27,1
"Ritalin","FIRSTTIMER","June 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Went on Ritalin for the first time today and I hated it. Took 5mg at 8:30am and then another 5mg at 12:30pm. Within an hour of taking both times I was falling asleep at my desk and had to follow up with a coffee to stay awake. I didn’t feel as though it made me anymore alert or focused. The second pill I took after an hour and a half I felt hot and my heart rate increased. I did notice it suppressed my appetite for 3 hours. In the afternoon I suffered severe irritability, to the point where I was yelling at colleagues then suffered what I believe was a panic attack. Felt not on control, was crying uncontrollably. I forced myself to work out so I could work the Ritalin out of my system. Horrible :(",1,18,1
"Ritalin","Susan","June 17, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've always known that I battled with either ADD or ADHD since childhood.  I never bothered to get formally diagnosed, but if left untreated it results in severe anxiety and depression. Due to this I lost my job and realised that it was affecting the quality of life.  I got assessed and diagnosed at the age of 43 with Adult ADHD - severe.  I was really scared to take the Ritalin because of the bad reputation it has but the difference was immediate.  I feel calm, at piece, no more anxiety, can focus.  It is life changing.  Side effects minimum.  I think this med is demonized unnecessary.  I have my life back.",10,56,1

After years of cycling through pretty much all antidepressants on the market, including SSRIs, SNRIs and tricyclics, I was starting to get desperate and hopeless and ready to give up on my life. I was stoked to encounter a diligent psychiatrist who concluded that my suffering was caused by untreated ADHD. I have been prescribed with Ritalin. This medication saved my career, my relationship, and my life in general. My mind is clear, my anxiety and depression resolved. I am no longer hopeless about my future, and I finally managed feel joy of living. Compared to my experience with antidepressants, I feel very natural and myself. I can experience a full range of emotions again. The side effects are minimal, especially compared to antidepressants. Looking in retrospect at my life and getting a bit more educated about ADHD, I have realised that all my past struggles made perfect sense - I was misdiagnosed and treated with wrong medications for a very long time.",10,53,1

The ability to stay on task is amazing. I take the immediate release 2x per day (10mg/pill). It takes about 30 minutes for the effects to kick in, but it is subtle. Each dosage lasts about 4 hours hours. I take the first pill around 800am and the second at 1pm. I take it Monday - Friday, and sometimes on weekends, if I have a project I'd really like to get completed.  At this point, I haven't experienced any noticeable side effects. Yes, it does kill your appetite during the 4 hour cycle, but it does return quickly thereafter. For anyone looking for the best vitamin/supplement for improved productivity due to ADHD, just go to your doctor and take something that's proven effective and regulated by the FDA.",10,35,1

After years of talking about projects and ideas, it is now quite easy to get and stay on task. It's not like I didn't get things done before, but  now I am motivated to complete tasks. In the past, most projects that required any substantial amount of time to complete would immediately be put on the back burner. Now I feel motivated to see them through.  In the past I would self-medicate with large amounts of coffee, but that only lasted for so long. Now, I have switched to Decaf and take medication once I get to the office. My dosage is minimal at this point and have a follow-up to see where I'm at in regards to possibly changing the dosage in a couple weeks. With my dosage (immediate release) I can tell the medication is kicking in as I start to feel warmer. That takes about 30 minutes. As others have stated, this dosage last about 4-5 hours.

I still felt tired at times but nothing like before where I was literally ready to collapse by mid afternoon.  It also suppressed my appetite a bit which I need.

I have been taking this drug when I was 14-15 years old and at the beginning it works well but then because I took a high dosage of Ritalin (around 60-80 mg daily) I experienced a few side effects (just like increased heart rate, weight loss and insomnia! So I stoped taking this drug and after that I have been taking Strattera (atomoxetin) for a year but that was terrible. I had insomnia so bad I couldn't sleep for 36-60 hours maybe twice a week and besides that I usually slept 3-4 hours), I also had increase hearth rate (maybe 100-130 in the morning, increase blood pressure(100/190), headache and stomach problem. So I stoped taking this medication too. Now I am 18 years old and I started to take Ritalin but not every day only when I have to learn a lot and just 10mg twice a day and I think it works very well and it has no any side effects.

Vayvanse also works well but it lasts for so long, 12 hours or more. I can still eat and have appetite on adderall and Ritalin but with vayvanse I could go all day without eating.

Over the years I have run across multiple medical professionals who will not prescribe this mediation. Like an idiot I listened to them and tried other medications. ALL of these medications had worse side effects and did NOTHING to correct my ADHD. They tried all of the non stimulant medications and Bupropn HCL - none worked and several had VERY bad side effects. Medical professionals who refuse to listen to their patients should lose their license to practice. You are messing with people's lives here, people!

It was a bit of a journey to find the right formulation and dose.  I take this form of short acting Ritalin after the Ritalin LA wears off (usually 6-7 hours). Pros:  Works quickly, cheap, well known and researched, relatively easy to obtain (not as much of a shortage as other more fancy formulations), and works for a large population of people with ADHD. Cons:  Wears off quickly (sometimes 2 Hrs for me), feels like a bumpy ride of ups and downs, hard to remember to take on time. Drink lots of water, make sure you graze on high protein snacks to avoid getting hangry, take a shower and get up and do something.

"Ritalin","PelicanMountain","April 21, 2010","-","I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. It seems I also have ADHD, Idiopathic Hypersomnia (not narcolepsy, but an unknown reason for excessive sleepiness), and a host of other symptoms. Ritalin was a life saver. I am able to think clearly again, I can wake up in the morning, and stay awake during the day, and my creativity is back (Artist/Crafter). It seems my tolerance is building, so my doctor tried me on LA; in a 1 month test I had a rocky start, but once my system adjusted it worked wonderfully. However, now my insurance company won't pay for it. Always one step forward, two steps back.",10,46,4

"Ritalin","Anonymous","December 15, 2009","-","I have 9 yr old twins who have ADHD. They've been on Concerta we are up to 36 mg and it was doing nothing. When they started having side effects - constant picking of scalp, sniffling, and puckering of mouth they were taken off. We then went to Adderall and they both got very aggressive. We are now on Ritalin 20 mg. One just started today so I'm not sure how it's going to go with him but the other has been on it for awhile and he's doing so good. He wants to take it, it makes him happy he says. Today when I took them to school he held his 5yr old brothers hand when they walked in. For some people that may not be a big deal but before he didn't want anything to do with him. He is very talkative on it but very sweet and helpful.",8,65,5

"Ritalin","Anonymous","October 23, 2009","-","I'm a 40 year old male who didn't have the benefits of medications when I was in school. ADD wasn't as well known back then. I was diagnosed with hyper dyslexia. I always thought that it was strange because I didn't see letters backwards but I just accepted it. I was officially diagnosed with ADD in my mid 20's. I have taken most of the medicine options over the past 12 years including Concerta, Strattera, Adderall, Ritalin and Ritalin LA. Couldn't sleep on Concerta, I was out of my mind with Strattera, Adderall was like popping caffeine pills and Ritalin was too high maintenance as it neutralized after 2-3 hours. Then I found Ritalin LA. It's not the magic bullet but it's the best that I have found so far. It costs me 10X generic but worth it.",9,69,5

"Ritalin","Anonymous","October 5, 2009","-","For years I had been battling behavior problems with my son who is now 10. He was not a bad child but had no concentration span, would fidget, annoy others and was falling way behind children the same age as him. Finally we managed to get him seen by a specialist. He is now been on Ritalin 15mg for 4 months and the change is unbelievable. He is already catching up with his school work, making more friends as he understands them better and is generally just more content and happy. At first he was teary and clingy when first put on them but that soon went. The only down for my son is that he is not as hungry as he used to be and lost a lot of weight in the beginning but is steadily putting it back on now.",10,85,5
"Ritalin","Kevin12","June 18, 2009","-","Well my experience with Ritalin really changed my life and I really mean really. This medication has a lot of pros as well as cons. Without Ritalin I could not do anything in school, I was literally paralyzed. Everyone did better than me but I tried the hardest and I just couldn't do it there was no way. So when I got Ritalin it made a huge impact on my life, I mean huge. This substance really changed me, the way I acted the way I thought. It was amazing I fell in love with it. I took proper amount everytime 40MG - 60MG. Now I have been taking Ritalin for 7 years. The only cons are, it makes you very still after a while, and depression but I can deal with it.",0,63,5

"Ritalin","Marni Z","April 13, 2009","-","My 7 year old son has shown ADHD symptoms for about 2 years or so but due to many changes in his life, I was unsure of the reason for this behavior. Now we've been settled in for &gt;9 months and he has not improved, we have decided to medicate (after dietary changes and omega 3 gave no help). He has been taking Ritalin 10mg for 12 days now. The 1st week he had only morning dose at 8am. This wore off around 1pm. This week I've dosed him 4 hours later also. From 1st day the change was amazing. He was attentive and followed instruction throughout his swim lesson and his school teacher found great improvement in attention span, concentration and finishing tasks. He is not as angry or frustrated now. The only negative is that I find he gets emotional and 'teary' as it wears off.",9,87,5
"Ritalin","Anonymous","April 13, 2009","-","I used Ritalin when I was in 1st grade. Until I was in 6th grade these tablets helped me a lot with ADHD. But I outgrew the hyperactivity. The reason I rated it a 9/10 was because in 6th grade the medicine was working well but I was on 200mg of it so the doctor had to take me off of it fast. Then I had a Ritalin crash in a overnight hospital. But other than that it is a great drug for treating ADHD. It helped me pay attention and not to jump off my mom's dresser (the dresser story is true about me).",9,44,5
"Ritalin","cookin'D","March 16, 2009","-","Diagnosed with ADHD at 53. Who knew there was a reason for my quirky personality.  Tried Stattera and slept 15-18 hours a day, was switched to Ritalin and thought this was it. I really like how I feel, calm, focused.  My friends noticed. I did great for a couple of weeks and then became extremely impulsive and inappropriate.  I was focused, but on warp speed.  I gained 10 lbs in a week, because I could not stop eating once I started, I went on shopping sprees, driving jags, blurted out without the think before you speak button.  Once I started a task I had to finish, my kids were late to school, you get the picture.  This was definitely not the drug for me.  I stopped taking it a couple of days ago, I am still feeling the effect.",4,68,5
"Ritalin","Anonymous","March 11, 2009","-","I've been on this medicine for about a month and lost around eleven pounds. I initially got on it to stay more focused in school although I don't have a serious case of ADD but I don't mind the weight loss. I could spare a few pounds. You get a rush for about 45 minutes after it kicks in and that feels better than it should. I feel I can concentrate when I use it, but I'm not myself when I take it. My personality is dulled a bit and even if I have homework to do, I'll find something to distract myself. Whether it's choosing a simpler assignment or just writing because I still feel like I'm being productive.",7,65,5

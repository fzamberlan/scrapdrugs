"Imipramine","Zak","September 5, 2019","-","My doctor gave me imipramine for my OCD. Within 8 days of starting this medicine, I could pick up a book and read it in 45 minutes.  Astounding, since I've had terrible difficulty with reading my entire life. Sadly I had to stop taking the medication after two weeks due to a strong anticholinergic effect that was causing pretty severe bladder pain and urinary retention.  I feel this tricyclic unlocked an extra 20 IQ points that were previously inaccessible to me. OTHER info, my visualization abilities were truly astounding while on imipramine that first time. When I thought of something, I could ask myself to visualize an 'abstract geometric representation' for instance of whatever I was thinking of.  And POOF, a bright neon like abstract shape would appear in front of me.  And oddly enough I 'understood' its relationship to the original idea.",10,6,1
"Imipramine","Katherine R.","August 3, 2012","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have insomnia and fibromyalgia. The pain from the fibromyalgia is worsened when I can't sleep well.  My doctor prescribed this medication to me mainly for better sleep. He said that this medication was one of the first non-stimulant medication for ADHD (which I've been diagnosed with) and so it may help with my ADHD symptoms as well.  When I first started taking this I felt nauseated all the time, for about 2 1/2 weeks.  Once that passed I felt like I really was sleeping better.  About 2 months in I started having vivid hallucinations and 6 months I started having kidney pain and urinary tract problems.  I'm now trying to ween myself off of it because sadly the side effects are outweighing the better sleep.",3,25,1

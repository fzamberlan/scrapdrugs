"Dexmethylphenidate","Boymom","June 11, 2020","-","I have a 5 year old son. He started this medication dexmethylphenidate for his ADHD about 2 months ago. It has made him zombified &amp; he cannot complete a sentence &amp; he’s very confused when trying to talk. When he does talk he talks extremely low and nobody can hear him. When he doesn’t have this medication he is off the walls with his behavior. Hitting kicking screaming telling us no &amp; just extremely terrible behavior. He does not eat while on his pills &amp; he barely drinks anything. He also does not like it loud or a lot going on he’d rather be in his room by himself unless I make him go out &amp; he’s the same like a zombie. The dose he takes is 10MG in the morning and 10MG in the afternoon. He has lost weight but not a ton. I feel as if it makes him angry when he’s not on it &amp; like he has no care in the world when it wares off. It’s like this medication has med his behavior worse than when he took no medication sometimes. I wouldn’t recommend this medication &amp; I’m glad I’m not alone.",1,0,1
"Dexmethylphenidate","Ralph","June 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This dexmethylphenidate is the only medication I have tried thus far for my ADHD that has had a good effect on my life. When I take the 30mg Focalin XR that is prescribed to me, I can actually think clearly, have the motivation to do the things I need to do, and it makes me feel like a normal, happy, productive member of society.  The only bad thing I can say about this treatment is that it makes my fingers and toes more sensitive to the cold, but I have never lost feeling or complete color in any of them so I believe that it’s not a major cause for concern at this point in time",10,0,1

I also recently started taking 10mg of regular focalin around noon-1pm as I work from 3am-3:30pm doing medical screening with an hours drive each way. Typically for a regular 9-5 work day the XR was more than adequate. The 10mg gives me just enough of a boost to get through till I get home at 4:30 without keeping me up when I go to bed at 5pm. Pros: -Best focus I've ever had in my life -Nice energy boost to get me through the drive and the shift despite odd hours  Cons: -Some mild dry mouth for about an hour after taking it  -Mild shaking off the hands for about half an hour after taking  -When the first dose wears off I am slightly more tired than without it",10,0,1
"Dexmethylphenidate","kat","April 27, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Focalin (dexmethylphenidate):</b>			 Focalin 40 mg XR. I found that that this medication was mostly ineffective. If anything it has an initial kick and wears off extremely fast. I thought it would be like adderall xr which I could feel the effects come and go throughout the day at 30 mg. With focalin its just one burst of euphoria/adrenaline/ and then you crash and feel nothing  except for the physical side effects like chest pain, rapid heart beat, muscle tenseness. I took a nap 2.5 hours after taking it which is ridiculous. It is frustrating because you don't feel the sense of focus that adderall gives. I only took it for two days before I called it quits because I did not see a benefit and decided to go back to adderall 20 mg IR. This medication did not suit me as a 27 year old grad student. I felt anxiety and panic attack symptoms with the second dose I took and I did not want to continue. It actually had a negative impact on my work input for those two days.",0,4,1

It definitely helped me pay attention in school, and there was a noticeable difference between days I did take it, and days I did not. However, for me at least, the side-effects outweighed the benefits. I'd been on it from the ages of 7-17, and throughout those years I noticed a complete change in behavior. Muted emotions, loss of appetite, depression, insomnia. I paid more attention in school, sure, but all of those years I'd lost important emotional development time. It's only after being off of this drug for 5 years that I realize just how emotionally stunted it had made me over the years. I'm in college now, and admittedly it would help me get better grades. But I wouldn't take it again if someone paid me to do it.",0,8,1

FOCALIN however,  was possibly the worst experience of my life. Focalin took every bit of anxiety and sadness and threw me into several panic attacks.

The worst 2 years of his life.  He did not have problems with good grades to begin with but just could not focus at school or home.  That landed him in more trouble with the teachers.  Took him off for 5th and 6th grade.   7th grade has been a nightmare.  Grades for the first time  were horrible and ALL 6 teachers said he can’t focus and they became aggravated but not because he was disrespectful but cause they were tired of redirecting him.  So back to the dr we go 2nd semester. They put him on focalin xr and. Wow what a difference.  He has bumped up to 10mg.  He can tell the difference himself.  He said mom I kinda felt like a genius today instead of saying I can’t do it, it’s to hard.  Focalin has the least amount of side effects by far.",0,14,1

I started with Focalin 20mg XR once a day, then 5 years later my doc added a regular 10mg dose in the afternoon. This has been a fantastic medicine for me. Would not be able to perform at work without it. Two negative side effects (but the benefits outweigh them): 1) Intestinal discomfort and bowel movement like clock work about 60-90 minutes after I take it in the morning. I have to avoid scheduling meetings for that time. 2)  meth dick  or  meth penis  which basically is caused by reduced blood flow to appendages. Get cold hands and feet too. Luckily it doesn’t impact size of erection since blood is flowing then. It’s just ego bruising when shrinkage occurs. On the weekends I skip the 20mg dose and take 10mg around noon so I don’t have to take two doses, also giving my body and brain a rest from the stimulant. My appendages feel warmer too.

Focalin definitely helped my anxiety, and it allows me focus on the important things (like school work/conversations). I don't take it during weekends, or even sometimes during the week if I don't have much to do which works out for me. If I did that on concerta, it would just increase my anxiety when I went back on it. Also, since it only lasts for about 8 hours, it doesn't cause any sleeplessness later on in the evening. I even experience less of a dry mouth than when I was on concerta!  Bad side effect for me was mainly weight loss, but I got over that by forcing myself to eat lunch, or eating a big breakfast/big dinner.",8,2,1

Generally 5-10mg has worked best for me. It helps me a lot when there are tasks I need extra focus on, and a lower dose can help in social situations. I found it to be helpful for school, and more recently at work. The worst side affect for me is a loss of appetite. I find that I have to totally guess how hungry I am and force it down so I don't get brain fog. It relieves anxiety in that I can finally do what I need to, but it raises anxiety in general.

It helps my concentration and ADHD issues for maybe the first 2 hours or less after each dose, but then from there, it causes terrible anxiety, depression. It makes things worse than actually helping when it starts wearing off (which is very quickly). Overall, I don't like Focalin at all. It not only comes with mental side effects like I mentioned but also physical side effects as well such as: shortness of breath, rapid heart beat, constant feeling like I have to urinate but can’t, fatigue, etc. It’s been over 3 months and it hasn’t helped my ADHD consistently or effectively anywhere close to stabilizing and treating it.

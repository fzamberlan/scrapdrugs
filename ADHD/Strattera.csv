"Strattera","Anonymous","May 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This Strattera is  the best ADHD medication I've had so far. It takes a LONG time to kick in. I was supposed to feel the full effects a month into taking it, but I didn't get them for maybe 2-3 months. However, it was worth it for me. Instead of just giving me energy and turning me into an emotionless robot like stimulants, it reworked my brain.  My whole brain functions better now. I don't procrastinate, and I can pay attention and work better. I have branched out into different hobbies because it gives you motivation. This is in effect 24/7 because it doesn't leave your system or wear off like stimulants. Now, the side effects. I still zone out and dissociate. There is a decrease in appetite (not as bad as the stimulant in that area, though). I have vivid dreams/nightmares. I feel tired often, and nap a lot. Also, I feel more depressed in general. None of these side effects are very severe, but they can be difficult at times. However, I really do recommend giving Strattera a good chance.",7,16,1

"Strattera","Dream","February 24, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have Manic bipolar / anxiety/ VERY POOR FOCUS and I take this with Buspar 15mg . It was really good the first 2-4 weeks I could focus I had a burst of energy I felt so good I could feel it working I no longer had racing thoughts I was so much calmer. But after the 4 weeks my poor focus came back I am now on 60mg  once a day and still feel nothing I’m extremely agitated and annoyed with everyone yet calm as hell still but waiting to blow if u get that. It definitely helps with impulsive behavior and calming the mind and feeling low but maybe it’s the combination of pills I take cause I swear I rarely feel low anymore never been better I just hate that It doesn’t work as potently as in the beginning",6,6,1
"Strattera","Philip V.","February 12, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’m 18 years old, suffering from chronic depersonalization/derealization disorder (DPDR) and ADD. I was really thankful when I finally found out, that I have ADD. It explained every aspect of my life that I, my friends and my family couldn’t understand (you all know what I’m talking about). So I started using Strattera. On 10 mg, I didn’t feel anything.  On 25mg I started having some problems with insomnia and little bit of anxiety. On 40mg I finally got to know, what real anxiety is. Staying up ‘till 3 am, sitting on my bed with racing thoughts, fast heart beat and high blood pressure. Being sure, that I have Schizophrenia and that I’m going to loose control of my brain. Waking up a few times per night, sometimes with hypnagogic hallucinations and feeling like a total trash throughout the next day. Also wasn’t feeling any relieve from ADD and my DPDR got significantly worse, ‘cause of all the anxiety.. Can’t blame the drug, every brain is different. I hope It will work for you. ;)",1,20,1
"Strattera","Lizard","February 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been taking strattera 40 mg for a couple months now and so far so good. The main thing that I have noticed is how much calmer and less restless I am. I am not as easily irritated, I've been sleeping better, I talk slower, I interrupt less, I fidget less. My cravings for salty, sugary, greasy foods has also decreased substantially, and I am more inclined to eat healthy and more nutritious or filling food. I have not noticed many effects on my attention span, so even though my body has slowed down my mind still feels like it is zooming right along. For this I have been re-prescribed a low dose of vyvanse at 10 mg to take every so often (I took 40mg vyvanse for a few years prior to starting strattera). I am also on 150 mg of Wellbutrin.",8,21,1

I had developed a viral infection which developed disability in my legs, arms, and most of all my brain. It can have some bad side effects. The best I have experienced from this prescription is that's it's a very great pill ! It can help you focus more, relax, and controls up and down mood swings. When I need to focus or calm my anxiety down I can use this medication. I have been on this medication for about 8 years now and I'm 21 going on 22! A very great medication!",8,15,1

I took 20 mg of Concerta/Ritalin when I was younger, and it always helped me within an hour of dosing. I read that it may take longer like 3 to 6 weeks to help me with my ADHD. I am going to continue taking it for 6 weeks and see what happens. Does anyone else have any experience to share?",1,21,1
"Strattera","KB","January 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been on Strattera for two months now for ADHD. It took about 6 weeks for it to kick in and start working. I don't feel that it helps with all my ADHD problems, but it does help with a few. I've had terrible side effects, including loss of appetite (I've lost 10 pounds since starting the drug due to loss of appetite). I also get really bad hot flashes and any time I go into a moving vehicle I feel nauseous. I can't sleep at night and I can't stay awake in the day. The side effects are not worth the small benefit I get from this drug.",3,14,1
"Strattera","Mikey","January 11, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","It does work. But, give it two or 3 weeks. You will feel weird in the beginning and a little nauseous. It goes away. I do feel like I concentrate better and focus longer. Be careful with caffeine! It makes caffeine much stronger and last longer. After a few months while on it I get very irritable and tense. I need a break and let it wash out. No problems stopping cold turkey. Take 80mg a day. Overall, its good. Not perfect tho. Orgasms seem delayed for some reason and slightly less of a sex drive. No changes in weight.",7,26,1
"Strattera","Mature Female","January 5, 2020","-","At 34 I started Ritalin.  It had up &amp; down effect. At 46, I began Staterra.  Hated it. Gained 35 lbs; anxiety soared; was fatigued &amp; lethargic.  My current dose is 60mg 2x/day. I never lost weight, but I feel normal.  I don't limit caffeine intake. I drink tea, no coffee. Anxiety &amp; depression are better w/Straterra. Just added 40 mg Adderall as menopause dulls the effect of Straterra.  It has caused high BP &amp; urinary retention. Yet I haven't stopped Straterra in 14 yrs as alternative is dysfunction  With my daily dose(120 mg)over the max, changing insur. &amp; MDs involves much hoop jumping. Cost of Straterra (&amp;generics) is very high. Some generics are not as effective.  Overall, give it time to become fully effective, carefully weigh pros and cons, don't expect to eliminate all ADD behaviors, set realistic behavioral goals, &amp; closely monitor self.  Med is NOT a panacea; it  is one tool on the journey to living as your authentic self.",9,18,1
"Strattera","Ragedabyss","January 5, 2020","-","I will admit there has been a huge improvement in my ADHD since I started taking this Rx. And since I already take a depression and anxiety med I don't have issues with those. No the problem is that it's killed my sex life. My girlfriend and I used to have a healthy sex life but since I started this med my libido has all but gone, strange things happen during intercourse, and I have painful orgasms. I can't decide if it's worth it yet but I'm leaning towards no",4,10,1
"Strattera","First time Strattera user.","January 3, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I’m a 27 female, previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I currently take Lexapro 10mg once a day, which controls my anxiety and the majority of my depression. Though my depression still exists and I have an inability to concentrate and I’m tired constantly. I started on Strattera 3 days ago, so I wanted to document my progress. On day 2 I started experiencing nausea and I took off work. My doctor suggested over the counter nausea medicine before medicines like Zofran, and it’s been helpful. I’m supposed to be careful and monitor my anxiety so that it doesn’t increase, but as of right now it’s under control. I lost sleep last night, but I took it in the morning instead, so we’ll see how well I sleep tonight. Update you all in a week.",5,17,1
"Strattera","ghchgfutfu","January 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Started off on dose of 40mg Strattera, upped to 80mg after a month. Seemed pretty effective for the first few months, concentration was much improved. It is currently 18 months since I started and the effects have reduced to pretty much nothing and concentration levels are as low as they were previously. I also have serious sexual dysfunction as a side effect, including loss of libido, erectile problems and ejaculatory dysfunction. I wanted to go on Strattera to avoid the loss of appetite side effects of the stimulant medications but this also has some loss of appetite side effect. I hope to go back onto a stimulant medication soon after review from my psychiatrist.",2,6,1
"Strattera","Mother of a Middle Schooler","December 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Our daughter started taking this medication in October for ADD after failing school. After a month, we noticed a huge change in her ability to focus and obtain excellent grades. She was finishing her work in class and doing extremely well compared to before Strattera.  She just made honor roll and never fights or complains about school work anymore.  Our only concern, is that we’ve noticed our 11 yr old loosing weight. She is skin and bones and has dropped a clothing size. She says that food isn’t good anymore and has to basically force feed herself. I’m afraid we may have to stop the medication if this doesn’t improve, which is unfortunate because it has so many great benefits and has changed our lives.",9,32,1
"Strattera","ChriS","December 20, 2019","-","I was taking Concerta but had to go down from 54mg to 30mg because of side effects. With Concerta, I was saying everything that was on my mind and I still could not concentrate enough as my mind was all over the place. I read somewhere that combining Concerta with Stratterra has helped control more ADHD symptoms for some. Started 2 weeks ago on 18mg, and co-workers appreciate. It really gives me the couple of seconds to think about what I'm about to say, improved working memory, and I take it at night since it lasts almost 24 hours, when I wake up, it is easier and I get to work  ahead of time. Starting on 25mg today and if still good, will not try and up the antes. Too much meds gives you side effects. So my goal is to be just ok, good enough to be a functional human being. Will let you know how it goes . I started with Strattera, now on the generic Pro Doc. Will tell you if I see a difference.",10,21,1
"Strattera","Elle","December 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Not a good experience. My doctor wanted to try a non stimulant option for my ADHD first because she was nervous about my anxiety getting worse. This drug was NOT the answer. Stopped eating and sleeping after about 2 weeks, until I had a meltdown and sobbed in my boyfriend's arms for hours. She switched me to a low dose stimulant option and I tolerated it much better. It might be a life saver for some but it was horrible for me.",1,9,1
"Strattera","Seatbelt","December 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This is my seventh time attempting the medication. I'm trying to do it right this time, no other choice. My experience has been to start at THE LOWEST DOSE... 10mg and stay on that for six to eight weeks before you increasing it. (10mg at a time) I usually expect and prepare for two weeks of awfulness in the way of side effects before things get better. I've learned to be VERY WARY of either nicotine or caffeine consumption with this medication. My experience with norepinephrine drugs like this is just a little bit of nicotine or caffeine sets off my anxiety and irritability. Helps me with psychosomatic pain along with cymbalta. Helps my anxiety. Increases alertness. Increases my focus but not nearly like amphetamine stimulants. Sexual side effects for me are not too serious. Orgasm as a male is irregular but I actually find it more pleasurable. I find it also useful not to combine much alcohol with the drug. Uppers with downers for me can be ugly.",6,14,1
"Strattera","Jen","December 11, 2019","-","Game changer for me. 60mg for ~3y.  Not magic bullet, but without it I couldn't be self employed. I still lose days immobilized or where all I can do is a few emails, but compared to weeks of incapacity without it. Eg without meds I can sit for hours thinking:  I need to do the dishes [add mental distraction here &amp; repeat] . Now I can go from thought to action; just get up and do the dishes!!  When I don’t take it negative self-talk starts in my mind, from how frustrating it is to not ever shift from thought to action. I can really tell the difference Advice: 1) REALLY important, titrate dosage up SLOWLY eg a few weeks or a month 20mg, same 40mg etc reduce any side effects. Don’t go too fast or start on full dose.  2) I can't take it til AFTER I eat enough and wait for my digestion to awake, or nausea. I can’t just take it WITH food on an empty stomach or even just AFTER Breakfast.  So I eat oatmeal and take the pill later after midmorning snack.  Otherwise I’d rate 10/10.",9,30,1
"Strattera","Hannah","December 8, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’m only giving Strattera 2 stars instead of 1 because it worked for focus, but the side effects were horrible. The first day taking it, I felt great. I had enough energy to get through the day and I felt present and in the moment. Then the next day I started to feel really strange. I couldn’t sleep through the night. I was majorly wired. I started to not feel like myself. My head was completely empty. I felt like a zombie tbh. I didn’t find things funny and I started to lash out at people which I never do. By like day four, I lashed out at my dad and then I broke down. I cried and was becoming really depressed. When I went off of it, my imagination returned. It was kind of a scarring experience.",2,16,1
"Strattera","Unorganized","December 7, 2019","-","Diagnosed age 46. Initially placed on med that works for son (methylphenidate - short acting 10mg) made me feel CRAZY - manic -like and my typical resting heart rate is 55 -on that it was 100, whoa uncomfortable. Psychiatrist switched me to Strattera 40mg x 1 mo. Side effects: sometimes morning nausea, intermittent dry mouth, mild constipation, took longer to orgasm, irritability. increased to 60mg x2 weeks then was supposed to go on 80mg. Insurance required a pre-auth so went off entirely for 1 month (gotta love US healthcare system!). Now last few days took 60mg a day  for 2 days then 80mg a day for 2 days. Side effects: EXTREME nausea 1 hour after taking but was taking on empty stomach so will change that, dry mouth 1-2 times a day. Resting heart  rate mid 60s. Haven’t tried sex yet, we’ll see. I am certain I am more focused. So far am happy w this. Worry a little about possible liver failure but that is very rare.

It took about two months to finally fully work, but when it did and I got over the side effects I loved it. You will experience some nausea and stomach pain in the beginning and sweating or feeling lightheaded if you don’t take it easy. I recommend eating lightly with it and make sure you drink water so your stomach acid isn’t going toe to toe with extended release. You may vomit if you don’t take it with a little food. Give it time. I focus easily now and my life has drastically improved. I’m getting my masters and work full time, and the medicine also regulates appetite and seems to raise the metabolism.

The only benefit of this medication, when it was used in conjunction with a real ADHD stimulant medication, was that it helped control the anxiety and tics that came along with using a stimulant.

NOTE: THESE ARE MY OWN OBSERVATIONS, YOUR EXPERIENCE MAY VARY. Pros:  - It gives me an insane amount of energy and direction. Drives me off the bed/couch to more constructive outlets. - It makes me hyperfocused at 80mg and decently focus at 40mg.  - There is no crash like amphetamines. Cons: - Some mild sexual side effects that disappear over time. - Weight loss - lack of appetite (Pro if you struggle with your weight? - just make sure you eat!) - Zombie effect - I noticed some kind of dulling of my emotions. I.e my lows are not as low but my highs are not as high.  - Cottonmouth/dry throat. I'm constantly drinking water. - Possible sleep disruption if you take it late in the day.",10,33,2

Fast forward 25years I was finally diagnosed with ADHD. Strattera 40mg was prescribed to me straight away along with an antidepressant. I was hoping to start stimulant medication but I was recommended this non stimulant. I am currently taking 100mg for a period of about 8 week's and have found it to help a little with focus but  has made me very impatient and irritable, mood swings. I find that my impulsive behavior is still there, I'm constantly looking to fill my day with some activity that gives me a rush of adrenaline or anxiety. I haven't tried stimulant medication so I'm curious as to the effects it might have on me. Overall I feel Strattera helps a little but I can't say definitively.",6,7,2

I had struggled so much with binge eating disorder, and (I think mild-moderate) ADHD, and with Strattera it was like a miracle. I can read things and feel/act on hunger.

But I sweat a shit ton after walking a couple flights of stairs or walking fast, and my heart rate goes from 70 to 122 every time.

If you are having side effects then I'd recommend taking this before going to sleep, you'll basically sleep through all the side effects. On strattera my memory has gotten better, I can focus more, I feel calmer when doing complicated tasks, I'm not so impulsive, and my appetite has reduced. It's not like the stimulants, it's more subtle and steady. I still have side effects, I get very tired, I'll get heart palpitations, and sometimes I get hot flashes. I now take this in the morning ALWAYS with food, otherwise I get nauseous. Strattera has helped but the stimulates made me focus 100x more, but unfortunately adderall gives me severe side effects (paranoia, depression) and ritalin didn't do anything.

Then, last night, I started uncontrollably crying and thinking terrible, awful things about myself that I have never thought before. . My partner said, That's the worst I've ever seen you.  I didn't take it today (I refuse to take that ever again) and after a week on it, I feel lifeless. Like a zombie. Like my personality, my thought life, my ability to function is just not there.

I take 40 mg a day, early morning, for ADHD, and thought it would help me focus, and be more productive. Instead, it seems to have just made me lethargic and exhausted most of the day. sometimes just wanting to sleep, instead of anything else.  I do feel a little more focused in general, but not in the areas I need to be, like during work.  I also started sweating... a LOT! I sweat buckets while on this medication, and I constantly feel hot, even when nobody else does. It can be rather debilitating. I already take a diuretic, so I am sure that this is not beneficial for me at all.  My mind does seem calmer, but I don't know if it is worth it for me if these are the side effects.",5,23,2

"Strattera","BT","August 5, 2019","-","Do not let negative online reviews and personal anecdotes prevent you from trying Strattera if suggested by your doctor! Side effects: at first, I had some nausea, alleviated by taking after food. Now, after seven weeks, I take it at bedtime and have no side effects. I can already notice a real difference! I tried Strattera last year but only took it sporadically for a few weeks, not giving it a chance to build up to a steady state and take effect. This time, I have not missed a dose, and I am now at the full dosage for me (100mg). In the past, I was prescribed Adderall. I was concerned that Strattera would not work for me, because I had already experienced the rush of the onset of a stimulant medication. Adderall also affected my emotions/behavior in negative ways. Strattera is an entirely different experience. Even when I do not notice its benefits in the moment, I can look back at my day or week and see the difference in my attention/focus.",8,65,2

While unmedicated, I would consistently have brain fog and I would never be able to focus. I would frequently have to ask others to repeat themselves as I would always drift off mid sentence. I never experienced hyperactivity. Every stimulant medication I tried (Adderall, IR Ritalin, concerta) all resulted in anxiety, and loss of personality. With strattera I feel as if the fog has cleared, while also maintaining my regular self- the most  normal  I’ve ever felt. I’m currently on 80 mg a day weighing 175 lbs. It took my body roughly 5 weeks to become fully adjusted to the medication and receive the full benefits. Just make sure to always take this medication on a full stomach or you’ll probably experience some nausea. Also, the first couple weeks I felt a little more agitated than usual, but this passed after the first few weeks. Give this medication a chance, especially if stimulants give you anxiety!",10,50,2

I was finally able to combat the nausea with high protein, high carb, low sugar breakfasts. About a month in, I realized that I had literally no desire to leave the house. At about 7-8 weeks, it finally kicked in full-force, coinciding with my husband being out of town for work. I found myself irritable, sad, and lethargic. He was having a good time on his trip and it just made me more and more upset. I struggled to not lash out. I felt like a moody teenager again. I did have moments where I felt more together - I feel like I was able to do a better job making myself stay on task when I started to get distracted.

Planning for the future is noticeably less stressful and I even found it easier to do simple things like grocery shopping and coming into work early. I’m still not perfect, because I have still missed a dentist’s appointment. I’ve also noticed less cognitive distortions, which makes things more comfortable. I will say that it still doesn’t help with the immediate distractions or impulses, like stimulants do.

I started a month at 25mg, a month at 40mg, and about 2 weeks at 80mg. Wow, have things really taken off for me! I am getting so much done at home and am motivated to get a job again! The one downside is the cost. Seriously? My insurance won't cover it so my 80mg prescription was almost $500! To combat nausea, take with food always! It may interact with vitamins too, so take those at the opposite time of day. Most side effects went away after 2 wks.",9,44,6

Recently it's impact on me has started to reduce. I feel that I am able to continue with tasks but am unable to apply focus on to the task. In other words I feel able to continue doing a thing but the quality of my effort seems diluted (beyond help). This is frustrating because I have to repeat things several times (such as reading things for my Masters degree). It has more or less ended other symptoms such as daydreaming, inability to continue at things, sleep problems, memory issues (though this to a smaller extent over time).I am going to get it changed though it works for some better than others.",4,12,6

With the 40mg I stopped noticing the benefits of Strattera and noticed more of the side effects (dizziness, hot flashes, etc). 60mg seemed to be the most effective for me. But after a week of taking the 60mg, I didn't go a day without nausea. The nausea was so bad that it practically cancelled out the benefits of Strattera. This is just what happened in my case.

I'd want to get 10 things done and I'd start 10 things but at the end of the day I'd have 10 things halfway done. He added Strattera to it, starting at 18mg and working up to 40mg where I am now. It has helped immensely. I now complete one project before moving to the next. At the end of the day I may only have 8 things of the 10 done but they are complete.

"Cariprazine","miss","May 1, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 Worst medication I’ve ever tried. Did not help with hallucinations/delusions, and I actually had more hallucinations while taking the drug. I was completely zonked out to the point where I could barely move/get out of bed. Also, I have a history of seizures and I had a few dangerous seizures that could’ve put my life in jeopardy. If this works for you then great, but I had such an awful experience with it that I can not recommend it to anyone.",0,4,1

"Cariprazine","Yikes","October 31, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I took this medication  Vraylar for around two months and had to stop taking it because I could not sleep at night and I couldn’t sit still for any longer than 30 minutes. Continuous feeling of crawling out of my skin. I was on 3mg. This medication also gave me a permanent head twitch that is super obnoxious, so I can’t imagine what else it would have done if I was on it longer. However, for my hallucinations and my mood, it was a lifesaver. My speech improved as well as my attitude. I felt like I could finally breathe. I was only seeing blotches of color which was pleasant for me compared to my very vivid hallucinations. Such a shame the physical symptoms are too unbearable otherwise this would have been spectacular.",0,16,1

I'm more compassionate &amp; considerate without any feelings of resentment. I'm even wanting to go to college still. It's so wonderful to be able to process things so normally on Vraylar. There's been some side effects like headaches &amp; others from allergies. Now thanks to Claritin/no supplements &amp; less meds, no more headaches.  I also learned all psychiatric medications &amp; supplements mess with Neurotransmitters on some level.  What's worse is they can also overlap in the targeting of those neurotransmitters causing undesired side effects.  That's why I'm doing optimally well with only 2 medications: Vraylar &amp; Prozac. A perfect combo that makes my life so easy. I'm normal.",0,2,1

I did not gain anything when I was on fewer mg.  I was also talking to people that I normally would not talk to in person and online.  When I stopped Vraylar I was shocked at the people that I had been communicating with.  I did find that on this medication it was easier to fall asleep.

It was a rough adjustment, to say the least. However, after finally getting on the right dosage (4.5 mg) and addressing the insomnia it caused (with 400mg  Seraquel), I am on top of the world. I was always high-functioning, but never able to fully recover for the duration of the time I was on Zyprexa and Haldol. I have fully recovered! I am now on track to finish my degree.

But today I want to share my experience with vraylar. I was taking this a year ago, at that time it helped me a little but my normal weight was 140 pounds and after taking the medicine I got to this at 175 pounds. I was very scared and not being mentally well  I  had to take it. But then I also started getting other side effects my body and my hands began to get wiggle movements which was a very horrible experience. I started reducing my dose down taking it alternate days until I stopped it. I recovered my normal weight 2 months ago. I am fine  now and I am not taking more vraylar.

"Cariprazine","cozy","September 18, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I rarely experience side effects from medications. I was only able to take 1.5mg of Vraylar for 3 days (nights) because it caused horrible nausea. ~3-4 hours of taking it the first night I was nauseous, then gagging, then vomiting. Throughout the day I felt nausea which lifted slightly around 11pm only to return a few hours after I took the next dose at 12am. Tonight I didn't take it, I'm done, but still feeling slightly nauseous and now I'm looking at the half life of this drug (2-4 days!).  It could be 2-3 weeks before I feel physically well again.

I have tried this medication alone in the past and it caused insomnia, and wasn't effective for psychosis at the 3 mg dose.  In combination with latuda, this is not a problem.  As of writing this review, I am at week 1.5, and it is really starting to kick in, feeling a bit better each day.  Never give up.

Don't get me wrong, it's better then crying constantly and having severe paranoia but it's a hard way to live.  I cannot feel emotions.

Antidepressants never worked for me and had awful side effects.  Antipsychotics worked better, but the older ones made me too sleepy, Abilify gave me ADD-like symptoms.  Latuda was pretty good, no cognition-affecting side effects, but it did sometimes give me bouts of annoying nausea.  I heard Vraylar was good at improving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which were very similar to the effects of depression in me, so I wondered if Vraylar would work for me too.

He's back on it now everyday, and his restlessness is progressively getting worse and his akathisia is bad.

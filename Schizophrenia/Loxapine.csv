"Loxapine","Joe","May 22, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Loxapine has greatly improved my quality of life. I hear less voices, and don't see anything anymore. Still hear voices, but less. I sleep better too.",10,1,1
"Loxapine","Drugreview","October 14, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was hearing voices to the point where I wasn't sleeping for 4 or 5 days straight. The voices would keep me up all night. I started Loxapine and within a few days the voices were quieter and I was sleeping almost normal again. Only getting woken up once or twice a night by voices. It has helped my delusions a bit as well, but not as much as the voices. I actually was able to lose weight on it too. Compared to gaining 20 pounds in one month on zyprexa. The side effects for me are very mild. It sedates you, so I take my dose at night. Overall it's been the best drug I've tried for schizophrenia so far.",8,6,1

"Loxapine","The Mad King","August 8, 2016","-","I switched to loxapine from risperidone because my doctor said that it wouldn't cause weight gain.  Unfortunately, I did gain weight on this as well.  It also had a sedative effect.  But in terms of treating my symptoms, it works perfectly fine.",6,8,1
"Loxapine","chocobo","April 17, 2015","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This medication worked for my hallucinations but I had involuntary blinking at all the different dosages I've tried. I was constipated thus causing me to have acne, had high blood pressure, and gained weight. Also, I felt so dehydrated to the point of getting headaches. I had troubles with being too sleepy to function.",3,7,1
"Loxapine","craig64","September 21, 2010","-","This medicine completely changed my life in the way that my voices are at ease and I can function in society correctly.  The side effects for me are severe tiredness.  If I have to stay on loxapine I will, but because of the tiredness, I am exploring my options of something else.",10,27,1

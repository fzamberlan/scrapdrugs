"Fanapt","Babybaker","September 4, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I have been taking 12 mg Fanapt for more than a year. My symptoms have become tolerable but the side effects are annoying. I am tired all the time and my whole body is sore. I don't think the benefits out way the side effects so I'm going to move on to the next medicine.",3,3,1
"Fanapt","Naava","May 3, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was on 24mg of Fanapt for about 2.5 years.  Prior to that I had tried probably every antipsychotic and the only ones that worked were Seroquel and Zyprexa but I gained 60lbs on them.  I finally came to the realization that Fanapt wasn't actually doing much for me.  I still had hallucinations and delusions and was acting crazy so I decided to come off it because I didn't see the point in taking it anymore.  I do have to say it had the least side effects compared to others I've taken.  The only thing it helped was my daily cycling of bipolar disorder but I'd rather not take anything than take an antipsychotic.  After quitting Fanapt I've lost all the weight.",6,6,1

"Fanapt","JakalSwitch","November 13, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Fanapt is the first medicine we've tried where I can function because of the medicine. I can hold a job now, the paranoia is wayyy down, and I only get a few hallucinations throughout the day.

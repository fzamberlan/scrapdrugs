"Olanzapine","Josh","June 1, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","This medication works to make the voices less irritable to listen to, and that's the upside.  Though fortunately I'm not forced to take it.  That's because I don't feel like me anymore just taking it once.  I can feel my emotions, thoughts, completely gone.   This really is sort of relaxing but it's a dull feeling in my mind.  I don't like it whatsoever.  I'd only take it if I really needed a break, though still I may think twice next time.",3,1,1

"Olanzapine","Alan","March 24, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug olanzapine cured my delusions that I couldn't stand every day since I was mentally unstable. I was feeling guilty all the time for no good reason it was weird to describe, I wasn't schizophrenic at all but playing with meds like lexapro changing quantities constantly day after day was a really really terrible mistake. After that I fell in to a guilt trip for something I did in the past that caused me to go crazy it's like PTSD but so much worse, my heart was about to explode. It's like demons tell me just finish yourself you're not a good person at all for doing this and that. After days of torture and delusions I got on olanzapine it made me calm no intrusive thoughts anymore no guilt anymore, but the down side effects of it, completely numb no emotions at all, all my senses are decreased to some degree, no motivation, waking up confused and sad.. I will give it a 7... sorry if my english is bad",7,1,1

There are a few side-effects however like lack of motivation or anhedonia and significant weight gain but overall I'd say if you're struggling give zyprexia a try to balance out the depressiveness and lack of motivation which is still an issue with taking antipsychotics zi also take antidepressants Cymbalta",0,7,1

I have considered changing the drug because I thought it was promoting my psychosis inside while normalizing my behavior on the outside but each time I stop it I can't sleep I get very very agitated and I feel like there's a burning in my skull and I feel like my mind is being seared.

At first I assumed the continued worsening of my mental state was simply my disorder developing by itself. I had to increase my dosage to cope with this.Then, as I took a break from the meds, my issues reversed. I finally gave up the meds and my psychotic symptoms are similar as to how they were before I was prescribed olanzapine, but not nearly as severe as they were whilst on the medication. This medication did more harm than good. Is it actually researched enough to be prescribed as easily and often as it is?

Would have been better to take it short term (maybe 3 months) instead of years.  VERY VERY hard to taper off of it no matter how slowly you do it.

"Olanzapine","LiamGamerr","August 23, 2015","-","I have been on this medicine for about 2-3 weeks now and although I missed a dose a couple of times it has helped me greatly. Before going onto this medicine I was awake for 3 days straight with racing thoughts/extreme anxiety and agitation. I still have anxiety but I feel more calm and collected. In terms of treating psychosis I have given this medicine a 7/10 (so far) because although I am getting some paranoid thoughts still, it has enabled me to think more clearly and rationalize them better. They are no where near as intense as they were before starting this medicine. I was talking to objects and saying strange things to myself in the mirror... this no longer happens and I feel more 'normal'. This medicine is great in a number of ways.",7,20,3

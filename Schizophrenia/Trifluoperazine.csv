"Trifluoperazine","The Husband from Australia","November 15, 2016","-","<b>Stelazine (trifluoperazine):</b>			 My wife used this, initially higher dose and then 1 mg for life, works wonderful till she stop using it and  she relapsed. Now she is on another medication, very popular but not for everyone. Will ask Dr. to consider putting her back to stelazine. Yes I do not know why stelazine is not popular now, with a low dose the side effect is almost negligible and the person can resume almost normal life as compared to the side effect of the newer and popular drug.",0,10,1
"Trifluoperazine","Carl 5000","August 8, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and at first was given haldol. Haldol stopped the hallucinations but also made me gain weight. About 5lbs a month. I switched to Stelazine, called Trifluoperazine in its generic form, and everything has been good. I take 2mg daily and 1mg cogentin to counteract side effects. I also take 50mg Seroquel for sleep. Now different medicines may work different for different people. But I had to share my experience and I hope this information can help you.",10,7,1

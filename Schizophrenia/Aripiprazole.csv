I acted in ways I never had before and where completely out of character for me. I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldn’t stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasn’t able to cope either. Horrible experience. Do not smoke marijuana with this I would advise against it it will use everything against you and become a problem and made me sicker.",0,1,1

It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being  up , I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels.

I will never be tapered off but the point in lowering is to maintain stability but at the same time control the insatiable  desire the meds give me to eat.

After refusing those other antipsychotic meds that have literally been around forever , abilify injection seemed to be a happy medium and you don’t have to take a pill everyday (because I know I won’t). If you find being on an anti psychotic indefinitely is your reality , abilify makes things easier. With the injection lasting a month long , it’s very incognito and doesn’t remind you that you are being treated - like taking a pill everyday",0,4,1

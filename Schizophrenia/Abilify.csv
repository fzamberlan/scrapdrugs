"Abilify","Helpfulmaybe","May 14, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Abilify made me completely out of control. I acted in ways I never had before and where completely out of character for me. I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldn’t stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasn’t able to cope either. Horrible experience. Do not smoke marijuana with this I would advise against it it will use everything against you and become a problem and made me sicker.",1,1,1

"Abilify","Lou","April 2, 2020","-","I'm on Abilify and no longer hearing voices but I still see people who aren't there. Even while on the highest dose of this medication 400mg injection.. I also feel like a zombie most of the time. I'm too tired even to go grocery shopping at times. I'm myself again but I'm not quite the same. I've gained weight 30 plus pounds and I've been on the drug for 3 years. I tried going off of it to 300 and the side effects were my moodiness returned... Sometimes I question if my diagnosis was correct or they are just pushing this drug out to anyone who claims they are depressed.",5,7,1
"Abilify","Endersmom","March 26, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","When I was first diagnosed with psychosis, about six years ago, they put me on risperidone. It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being  up , I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels. TL;DR in terms of fatigue, motivation levels and weight gain, abilify is, by FAR, the better choice over risperidone.",8,20,1

It takes away the bad thought but can make me have OCD like thought patterns and ruminating thoughts. I have been having odd side affects from it as well like blurred vision needing to look up all the time and sensitivity to light in my eyes.  I feel more tired on it then I do off of it.

It has helped with paranoia but I think the help is wearing off after a month because symptoms are returning.  I’m doing some for of CBT therapy which I hope isn’t bringing back things or triggering my schizophrenia symptoms but I’m still going on full force with medication because I’ve always stopped taking them early.   Here’s to hoping all these extra side effects that have happened only this last week end: increased anxiety, paranoia, and minor hallucinations.   On a side note these extra symptoms are manageable if I’m keeping busy and not letting my mind take control.   I just have to stay once the passenger seat.",6,9,1
"Abilify","WinterViolet","September 23, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started Abilify a week ago at 20 mg daily.  The only side effects I’ve noticed is that I fall asleep fine but I do have vivid dreams and tend to wake up throughout the night, then in the daytime I seem to have an inability to sit still for extended periods of time without moving or stretching.  That part is mildly annoying.  However, I have noticed a slight increase in energy level or the ability to just get up and take my dog out for walks and have started to get more motivated to actually get stuff done around the house, which off medication was very hard for me to do.  I’ve had no weight gain, or any other side effects yet but I have only been on it for a week.  20 mg is a high dose to start at but it’s what the hospital gave me so it’s what I’m taking.  I’ll update my post as I get a little further down the road with this medication.  But no voices as of late but still have those delusions that I’m being watched and followed.",7,18,1

"Abilify","Rocky blvd","May 12, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","When I was 24 years old out of nowhere I started having Schizoprhenia symptoms.  I believed incredible grandiose religious delusions, believed my television sets had cameras in them and believed when people coughed or made sounds they were mocking me subliminally.  I didn't receive treatment until the age of 30 and was working full time but getting myself in wreckless situations.  After I lost everything I have besides my awesome family, I was put on a Community Treatment Order (CTO)  and after 4 months on Invega I was extremely suicidal and thought I'd never regain my normal  life.  If there is one thing I have learned about meds it's that they take a lot longer to work than you think.  I have been on 10 mg of abilify for approximately six months and for the entire duration I would have intrusive thought and random urges, then finally going into the sixth month the side effects are really starting to subside and I'm starting to fully regain my emotions and not be afraid of people.",9,36,1

Took a very long time to get over the first medication but once I did the difference between the two was night and day. I am not dizzy when I stand up and my strength has returned. I still feel a little zombie like though so cannot give it a ten but no voices and no obvious side effects. If you are suffering from a not too severe case of schizophrenia, or a drug and alcohol induced psychosis, then this drug may just work for you. Best of luck.",8,26,1

Abilify worked so great for me, lost weight, wasn’t drowsy, voices dissipated, etc. Then a month later the problems started, I fell into a deep hole of nonstop gambling. It started out as just a simple free code bonus for online casinos. It then turned into a full blown addiction. Drawing my bank account anytime I got paid down to 1-0 dollars trying to win. Always chasing my losses. It has gotten to the point where I started opening credit cards for more and more gambling. I have finally put my foot down and said  NO More!   I Saw my psychiatrist today and came forward with my issues. She told me to taper off abilify and switch to Vraylar. Here’s to hoping the gambling floats away with the drug leaving my body!",6,11,1

It makes my ADHD go through the roof though.  A lot of pacing.  I stopped ADHD meds because of the psychosis, but I think I may start them up again since I know I was getting psychosis because of schizophrenia and not necessarily the amphetamines. As for side effects besides the above first week had a stomach ache and slight headaches.  Totally worth it though.",7,11,1

Of course what works for the guy next to me might not work for me and vice-versa because our genetic make up is different. I have been taking this drug for about 3ish years and well I didn't noticed a difference until about 2 months ago when I raised the dosage by 5mg a day. I was on other antipsychotics as well as antidepressants and stuff for bipolar disorder. I'm on 400mg injection of abilify monthly as well as 5mg pill form a day still to this day.

At first the doctors put me on 10mg which I hated because the dose was too high ( thinking about it now) . Then my doctor raised it to 20mg which was just making me even more emotionless. So I switched back to risperidone consta (injection), but I've always hated risperidone consta, so I thought my life was over. But then I noticed I had a full pack of abilify left over from before. So I decided to take just small dose of Abilify along side the risperidone consta, and guess what? The Abilify is great at such a small dose. It completely blocks the side effects of risperidone and I can live a greater life now. So I take  Abilify and have risperidone injection every 2weeks.",10,20,2

"Abilify","The Mad King","October 25, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I had asked my doc to change my medicine from Loxapine to something else that would allow me to get back to my baseline weight.  In 3 months, didn't see any movement towards my baseline weight.  I have been exercising (weights + cardio) for 1.5-2 hrs a day 6 days a week during this time as well while maintaining a pretty disciplined high protein diet.  My body fat % came down from 22% to 20% in a couple of months, but hasn't gone lower after that.  It's disheartening to see all that hard work yielding not so great results, which further affects my motivation to exercise considering I'm not seeing any more results.

"Abilify","Kora1986","September 25, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","Abilify 20 mg. I am a patient diagnosed with disorganized schizophrenia, depression,  schizoaffective disorder, bipolar.  I have experienced a sensitivity to my emotions, as well as how I react to my feelings.  I really don't feel out of the normal with any sexual frustration...and I wouldn't say this has increased/decreased.  I feel less anxious on the medication, and seemingly more at ease with myself when I take this medication.  It is a hard step to have people telling you that you actually do better on this pill, when half your life ago, you didn't have mental illness, and suddenly you become someone else.   My weight did fluxuate when on this drug.  But I feel it was due to stress factors outside of a regular environment.  I feel if you place yourself in good surroundings and support you do much better at being the person you are here to be.  I am so much happier in life with a routine.  I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions. Abilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, This medication is working for you.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals.  My thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.  I feel that I am just not the type of person to curbside answers to things we wonder deeply about, I guess.   I don't know if there are any people who would agree then that I should ask if there are any women who have taken abilify during a pregnancy?  Just wondering what the reaction is...  Is my question?  I am a 30 year old female diagnosed with Mental Illness starting in 2004.  I started to take Abilify 20 mg. in 2004 to present.  Overall, since this medication has not been threatening to me, I feel I should embrace it.",10,44,2

"Abilify","DeathForDrGoldIsTooGood","April 15, 2012","-","Worst experience of my life. Stuck in mental ward, oral administration at first. Unusual sensation and altered perception of internal space were the immediate experienced effects. Later injections. Developed tics that refuse to subside. Perceived loss of cognitive ability.",1,32,3
"Abilify","Anonymous","March 26, 2012","-","Just as a warning, I got rushes of aggression on Abilify. My psych said that is not uncommon, as the medicine does not suit everyone.",1,31,3
"Abilify","Anonymous","October 25, 2011","-","I've been on a variety of medicines over the years, including Risperdal, Geodon with Zyprexa, and now Abilify.  Though I feel I'm overly medicated at 40mg per day of Abilify, I've improved to the point where I don't hear voices or feel paranoid anymore and am active in the community. I take it at night and sleep around 9 to 10 hours per night.  Not sure if that's normal with Abilify or not, but I'm not complaining.  Surprisingly no other side effects.",9,52,3
"Abilify","Anonymous","January 9, 2011","-","So far, so good. Abilify is extremely strong, so I have found I am fine with just 5mg daily. Taking a lower dose gets rid of most of the unpleasant side effects (restlessness and constipation).",7,31,3
"Abilify","anna007","March 25, 2010","-","I've been on Abilify for about two months. So far I've found it to be weight neutral. At first I felt faint a lot but much less now. I also had tremors at first and difficulty speaking with a lot of tiredness but all that has passed. In all it helps my psychotic symptoms and delusions, not 100% but its good enough. I would recommend it to anyone its prescribed.",7,41,3
"Abilify","Diabetic Disaster","November 19, 2009","-","My mom who was on Prolixn for years was put on Abilify in 2005 and was on it until 2007.  She became more needy and more annoying, but wasn't having the psychotic symptoms as bad.  The mental health center who was regulating her medication never checked her blood sugar, only blood pressure.  She took a random blood test at a Walmart store and found her blood sugar was way out of control.  She comes from a family with no history of diabetes, and she did drink soda or eat high sugar foods.  She stopped taking the Abilify cold turkey which caused her to rebound into severe schizophrenic episodes. No one could reason with her.",1,37,3
"Abilify","Anonymous","October 2, 2009","-","I was on one Abilify for three years, for schizophrenia. At first I thought it was pretty good. It helped with motivation. But then I started gaining weight. Weight gain on Abilify is very unusual, my doctor said.  Anyway, I gained over 50kg, going from nearly skinny at 78kg (I'm 6 foot 1 inch) to morbidly obese at 132kg. Now I'm on ziprasidone (Geodon/Zeldox) and I have lost 7 kg in six months. Hopefully that weight loss will continue. So if you start gaining weight on this drug, don't ignore it, talk to your doctor about changing medicine.",5,29,3
"Abilify","Motherandson","September 27, 2009","-","This medication has helped my son a great deal. He developed schizophrenia when he was 16.5 years old. He came forward with his symptoms at age 18 and has been on Abilify for three years. Thanks for the medication. I wish they would get a generic form of it. $700.00 a month is huge for a thirty day dose.",8,43,3
"Abilify","psychmarshall12","July 24, 2009","-","This medication over a years period began to make me become well, not cured. I noticed it beginning in 2008. I was isolated since 1991 in my apartment. Now I'm riding the bus. I don't believe the abilify did this by itself. I helped it along.",0,38,3

"Abilify","Anonymous","March 9, 2009","-","I've used 5mg daily for three weeks. My delusions and paranoid feelings passed. I still have hallucinations (voices and visual). It's helped my thinking. Though it makes me very tired in the day. I hope it will continue to help.",7,31,4
"Abilify","sweetleola","February 7, 2009","-","I have been taking abilify for a week and it seems to be working. I take 5mg. The only thing I hate is it makes me sleepy. I wish that would stop.",0,24,4
"Abilify","Anonymous","April 9, 2008","-","I take this drug at night.  I would not recommend taking it in the morning.  It has really helped my paranoia. I have been taking it since 2004.",10,81,4

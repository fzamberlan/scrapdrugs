I was taking it for 6 weeks (3 weeks to get me on 900 mg and 3 weeks to get me off). Terrible vivid nightmares that seemed more real than reality. I was wondering if I am dreaming or is it real all the time. My mind was empty. My muscles were in pain, I couldn't properly move my body because of hard muscles. I had a feeling of being pregnant - smell and taste changed, I had contractions and I produced milk. Only when this happened doctors decided to put me off that drug. Thank God for body side effects, because doctors don't take serious when you tell them that a drug is bad for mind, emotions etc.",0,2,1

I've gained about 40 lbs, but I recognize how much stress I used to be under.

I read The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and started meditating. My third eye doesn't completely grip me with it's reality but I can still use it to get some closure from that past headspace.

I really wish they'd take me off the injections because I'm not at serious risk of harming myself or others. I don't smoke weed anymore, which is what triggers my panic attacks.

"Paliperidone","Anonymous","January 5, 2013","-","I've been taking paliperidone for the last year with good results: a proactive lifestyle including uni and drinking with no delusions, depression or paranoi and few hallucinations at night. However, the prolactin level has increased to where the possibility of breast tissue (gynecomastia) can form. As a preventive measure, my doctors have suggested that I change medication. I have had perceptibly minor side effects (akinesia [which annoys others, but when genuinely interested, I stop], monthly upper lip muscle tightening, sexual dysfunction, broken sleeps, vivid dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations [weird and sometimes scary]). Would recommend. Consult doctor, but if risperidone worked, try this as it's a metabolite of risperidone.",8,2,7
"Paliperidone","SoundSystem","November 25, 2012","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 The medicine is partly covered by my issurance company. Current maintenance dosage 3 mg (was 6mg) Invega. After taking Invega my positive symptoms vanished completely after a number of weeks, furthermore I don't get an unreal sense (depersonalization) which was the case with Risperdal. Unfortenately I got the following side-effects (discussed with my physician): - weight gain (8 kilo's) - sometimes strange expression around mouth, stiffness - tiredness/weakness, need more sleep - intense dreaming, sometimes nightmares - harder to breath through nose - increase of ALAT blood values (80) - dizziness after sudden activity - heartburn For now the positive effects outweight the negative effects.",0,41,7
"Paliperidone","Anonymous","May 13, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Invega Sustenna (paliperidone):</b>			 Invega is working great on auditory symptoms and no lethargy noted.  I have noted some of the adverse side effects after the first dose: sudden weight gain, indigestion, pain at injection site and sore throat. In addition to these there has been increasing facial and abdominal bloating, I am concerned but there is no other medicine I am aware of at this time and the doctor feels the benefit outweighs the side effects.",0,31,7

Was on Geodon previously and had to keep upping the dose to keep the hallucinations and voices at bay.  With Invega, I'm on the lowest dose and have an auditory hallucination maybe once or twice a month. Despite the risk of side effects, this is a wonder drug for me. I've had no side effects.",0,49,7

"Paliperidone","Anonymous","February 1, 2008","-","<b>Invega (paliperidone):</b>			 This drug works great for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has made me feel a ton better, and its benefits far outweigh the few side effects. Be sure to take exactly when you are supposed to and not try to catch up on a dose. I did this and had to go to the hospital for treatment of muscle rigidity and uncontrollable muscle spasms, but as I said it has only happened once and happened when I missed a dose and tried to double up. So this is a great medicine, but take as prescribed only.",0,112,7

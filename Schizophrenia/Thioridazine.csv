"Thioridazine","Not bad...but zombielike","March 10, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Works on paranoia really well, very calming. But this is really for SEVERE symptoms (mostly POSITIVE schizophrenic symptoms like hearing voices, paranoia). The higher the dose, the more zombielike. It literally is a chemical straight jacket.. But some of us need it.",8,2,1
"Thioridazine","Moochie","August 11, 2010","-","<b>Mellaril (thioridazine):</b>			 Moochie used to take Melleril, was always calm and hardly over ate. After being taken off that medication he now is prescribed Zyprexa. Zyprexa cost about 400 dollars for 30 pills and causes weight difference of 80lb gain over a three year period. Taking the Melleril never had signs of anxiety or stress. Slept comfortably and always went to bed on time at night. Since we no longer take the Melleril life has changed considerably. We now experience wandering at night, constant overeating to a weight gain already and he now being considered as obese. I recommend the Melleril as a excellent medicine as long as the side effects are not endangering the patient. The best medicine I've used to provide comfort.",0,26,1

"Zyprexa","S","April 18, 2020","-","It has worked well for me I had bad mani.    have gained weight though but zyprexa is very calming.",10,2,1
"Zyprexa","Cat","March 30, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I take 10 mg of zyprexa in the morning and at night. I use 1 mg of cogentin morning and night to stop side effects. Then I use 50 mg of vistaril for my anxiety.  But zyprexa makes me feel worse. The voices are still there. I'm more paranoid. I've gained 20 lbs in 1 month time. My appetite has increased. I have tremors throughout the day.  Plus the vistaril doesn't help much with my anxiety. I can't wait to see my doctor and get something else! I wouldn't recommend this medicine to nobody from my experience.  But each person is different.",5,3,1
"Zyprexa","Druger","February 15, 2020","-","I was on Zyprexa for 1 month and 1 week and in that time I gained 20+ pounds and did not help with ANY of the symptoms I was having. Didn't help with voices, delusions, paranoia. Nothing. Was really a complete waste of time and to top it off ruined how I look. (I used to be a very thin 160 pound male, and am now 220...) that's from all the antipsychotics I've tried combined. Zyprexa being the worst one for weight. I give zyprexa a 2 only because it did sedate me a bit relieving anxiety. I'm now on Loxapine which is supposed to be weight neutral but I'm still putting weight on from that a bit.",2,7,1
"Zyprexa","Geoff","November 4, 2019","-","I was on Zyprexa at 25mg (had Psychosis) for a few months, literally, the worst months of my life, all I wanted to do was eat and sleep so tired and foggy and I had no motivation so glad I ignored doctors and got off it as soon as I possibly could.  if there was an option for Zero I would give that this stuff is utter garbage.",1,16,1
"Zyprexa","ghj8","October 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started stelazine but the Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) WAS TOO MUCH TO Handle so I take 5mg of Zydis to counteract the symptoms.",8,2,1
"Zyprexa","Czr","October 17, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was on 15 mg of Zyprexa and it completely got rid of all my symptoms. The only complaints I have are weight gain and sedation. I gained 70 lbs in a 6 month period and slept for 14 hours every night. My cholesterol went over the maximum limit and my blood sugar rose to a level that made me a prediabetic. Other than that, I would try this drug again.",7,8,1
"Zyprexa","Sunshine","October 9, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This is the worse drug caused inability to do anything even stopped talking was given 15 mg by psychiatric hospital",1,9,1
"Zyprexa","mushroom74","August 26, 2019","-","I started off with 10mg, 7mg and currently 5mg  After refusing to take any medication because of prior complications and skepticism I finally gave in and decided to give it a try as a last resort. I started with 10 mg Abilify which made me very tired, sluggish and depressed so I switched to zyprexa 10mg the tiredness went away. paranoia went away. There are a few side-effects however like lack of motivation or anhedonia and significant weight gain but overall I'd say if you're struggling give zyprexia a try to balance out the depressiveness and lack of motivation which is still an issue with taking antipsychotics zi also take antidepressants Cymbalta",7,7,1
"Zyprexa","Ari","July 19, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","15mg of Zyprexa made me cry uncontrollably  and it dulled my emotions with drowsiness.  I don't know if I should continue with this because it's done more harm than good.",1,16,1
"Zyprexa","mickwicken","July 15, 2019","-","For 5-6 years I have taken Zyprexa for schizo affective disorder . Weight gain isn't a problem if you lift weights 5x5 and eat lots of protein during the day and a casein shake at night. You might still gain weight but it'll be muscle as long as you cut out carbs and sugar while eating more protein than your body weight and a lot of  fat that'll do it...",7,16,1
"Zyprexa","A.A","June 19, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","It has some initial side affects like feeling dizzy. But all in all after more than 7years I totally like the drug. I have been on 5mg for about 5years now. I took 5mg all through my pregnancy based on doctors advice and I gave birth to healthy baby girl 2 years ago. I was also able to breast feed because the drug was not found in my breast milk due to low dosage I was using   according to doctor's report.",10,20,1
"Zyprexa","Lee","April 14, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve taken Rexulti, ability, vrylar, resperidone, and now trying Zyprexa.  It’s been about a week and the delusions/hallucinations are still extremely there if not worse. This stuff makes me sleepy, I get a good nights rest.   I'm going to take it a few more weeks to see if it overall works, a week probably isn’t long enough for a good trial period.",6,6,1
"Zyprexa","jacmore","April 8, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I am  overall very pleased with Zyprexa for my Schitzo affective disorder. My son says he's never seen me so welI. I've been on this medication for about 8 months. I've gained about 25 kgs which I hate and I need about 10 hours sleep each night, but at least I am well.",10,14,1
"Zyprexa","NoJustNo","March 28, 2019","-","I take 10 mg of zyprexa at night and it makes me feel like it I've been chemically lobotomized.  Not to mention the irritability  And being tired all the time. This medication made me sleep for 10 whole hours and I still feel sleepy after waking up. Also my motor skills have been cut in half, I keep stumbling over stuff like I'm drunk and having blurred vision all day.  This medication is a mental handicap in a bottle.  How in the world does this help out with schizophrenia and depression??  I would not recommend this medication to anybody. Eli Lilly should be ashamed of themselves.",1,23,1
"Zyprexa","Cat","November 5, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","While I am schizoaffective, I was put on 2.5mg (now 5mg) of zyprexa for intractable insomnia after averaging 2 or 3 nights a week without sleeping. I now go without only sleep once a week. I also sleep much deeper. Unfortunately, I have gained 2.5lbs a month on it and have gone from normal blood sugar to circling pre-diabetic.  My doctor put me on 7.5mg briefly but my appetite was unreal. I wish I could take more but I've already put on 30lbs. I can't say if it has impacted my psychosis as the other anti-psychotic was working when I started on this. I think it helps with my anxiety. I sometimes take an extra pill when I have an anxiety attack. It helps but maybe it is the placebo effect.",7,11,1
"Zyprexa","elusiveperuvian","September 28, 2018","-","I took this medication for 9 months before the voices in my head went away. I continued taking this medication for two years. I'm still not convinced that this medication had anything to do with the voices going away. I think if it were effective, the voices would have stopped sooner. I also always felt sedated and never had any motivation to do anything. I used to be the person who always read all of the recent news and was well-informed but this medication turned me into a lazy and ill-informed person. I also used to run and do yoga often but this medication made me have no motivation to do those things anymore. I gained 40 lbs on zyprexa. I just started taking latuda two weeks ago and I have already lost 10 lbs and I feel like I have much more energy and motivation. The only issue is that now I have insomnia from zyprexa withdrawal. I wish my doctors would have originally prescribed latuda instead of zyprexa so I wouldn't have had to deal with the withdrawal.",2,11,1
"Zyprexa","Neuromancer","February 5, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","I liked Zyprexa, it helped me sleep. But boy did I get hungry when it kicked in, and fat!",7,9,1
"Zyprexa","Costa pork","September 21, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","This drug saved my life, I had been on almost all atypical meds with no luck.  Now I have been on 40mg of zyprexa for 10 years with no relapses, and have even managed to hold down a job. I gained 20 pounds and an now a type 2 diabetic, but it was worth it.  My family and friends noticed rapid improvements within a week of starting zyprexa. A little hint, when starting zyprexa, ask your dr to prescribe benztopine, it prevents many of the negative side effects of zyprexa. I hope this review helps some one :-)",10,30,1
"Zyprexa","theriddler","September 3, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was hospitalized because of a brief psychotic episode following some traumatic events in my life, one of which was contracting Stage 3 Lyme Disease.  They put me on Zyprexa 5 mg.  It worked for a few months, but the brain fog and lethargy was causing problems at work so I decided to taper down to 2.5 mg and then stop.  I really wish my doctor told me not to go from 2.5 immediately to zero because the withdrawal has been an absolute NIGHTMARE.  Scary dreams, non-stop anxiety, really jumpy, headaches, depression, and my brain fog has never been worse.  I finally knuckled under and am taking 0.6 mg just to take the edge off.  I don't want to discourage others seeking help but stay away from Zyprexa!",0,7,1
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","August 23, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","Zyprexa doesn't work well with any antidepressants - be careful - but it can work used together with lithium, depakote, or lamotrigine. The serotonin guided anti-depressants activate mania and rapid thinking, and fuel anxiety, drugs such as lexapro - taken with anti-psychotics - can be a nightmare. In mixed diagnostics such as schizoaffective, there are many bypasses and alternate routes  -  i.e., I take a minimum of risperdal, which helps with an additional foundation for more centeredness and 'structure,' - and keeps my head clearer on 1.5 mgs; and I also take 300 mgs seroquel XR, to act, not only as a bipolar safe keeper, but also as an anti-depressant.  If you're looking for Olanzapine with an anti-depressant edge, try bipolar meds.",0,4,1
"Zyprexa","voskhod","July 14, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","Although it started off good, this med slowly made me develop Akathisia to the point of it being unbearable. I started off on 10mg and it was increased to 15mg, by the end of it I wanted to amputate my legs just to make the feeling go away.  I was 24/7 agitated, restless, constantly pacing around and fidgeting, getting into arguments and screaming at people. My doctor prescribed Clonazepam but it did nothing to take it away. Eventually I had enough and stopped taking Zyprexa altogether, and within only 3 days all of these symptoms disappeared and I was back to normal. By the end of it, even though I was only on it for 3 weeks, I had gained 30 pounds. Awful experience.",1,6,1
"Zyprexa","Naboo Bear","December 20, 2016","-","Worked great for me. Not only did it control my perception of reality, it also takes away the strange emotional attachments that I was having. It made me go from sitting on the couch hidding, to working full time as an electrician, sometimes up to 10 hours a day, something I thought I would never be able to do again. There were only two problems. I was unmotivated, I didn't have any passion for life. I was  just going through the motions. However this is much better that being  psychotic and suicidal. In the 9 months I was on the medication, I gained almost 100 pounds. This happened even when I was eating the same amount as before I was medicated. Again, this is far better than being angry and paranoid.",7,20,1
"Zyprexa","Nutty Rich","January 13, 2016","Taken for 1 to 2 years","An amazing medication considering the earlier antiphsycotics available, I think its more expensive that could effect availability.  I do suffer from shaky hands but its the only side effect noticed.I take 20mg at night, it doesn't make me sleepy, no weight gain or hangover effect. Don't increase the dose it doesn't help it just gives restless legs and I was informed a dangerous to increase",7,32,1
"Zyprexa","Goodfella90","September 15, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was hospitalized after psychotic break proscribed Zyprexa 20mg at first the medicine was ok my paranoia and schizophenic thoughts went away. But after about two weeks i started to notice the side affects weight gain was the most obvious gained 40 pounds in two months and sleep i was sleeping 9-12 hours a night it was difficult to wake up in the morning. During the day i felt unmotivated and at work i had no energy even after drinking an energy drink.lowerd my dose to 5mg it didnt make difference. after about 6 months i had enough decided to try an other medication now i fell much better. bottom line Zyprexa was the worst med ive ever tried.If you want to try this med beware you will gain weight.",1,27,1
"Zyprexa","schizoeffective","July 20, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","This drug has turned down the volume on a lot of my voices. Which is great. I sleep better and take more naps during the day. Also notice my appetite increased which is where I think people mean they gain weight on this med. I just exercise an hour a day. My mood is kinda flat lined.",8,29,1

Seroquel have me peeing all night long, burning sensation like urinary tract infection. Abilfy sex was good but give me anxiety, fast heart rate, light headed feeling, fainting and insomnia.

"Zyprexa","DatMexicanLalo","April 4, 2012","-","Before I took Zyprexa I was hallucinating due to lack of sleep and exhaustion. While I was hospitalized I denied my medication and wouldn't take it but as soon as I took Zyprexa and Remeron my sleep got better. I stopped hallucinating &amp; hearing things. Thanks to my medication I haven't been hospitalized for psychosis since I've been given Zyprexa.",8,49,2

"Zyprexa","Anonymous","January 18, 2009","-","I've been taking Zyprexa for just over a year now and have seen dramatic improvements in my life. I used to be incredibly paranoid of people, was hearing voices and was delusional about my physical health. I'm on 20mgs of Zyprexa and most of my symptoms have cleared. Some of them remain, but they're much more tolerable than they used to be.  The only drawbacks I have noticed are weight gain and slowed reactions but I'd rather live through those side effects than experience what I did before treatment.",8,97,2
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","January 1, 2009","-","This medication killed my schizophrenia in two months. But I gained 20 pounds which is okay considering I was a little underweight. The worst side effect was that my eyes would not move. Finally a doctor told me to cut down my dosage from 10 mg to 5 mg and this lowered the occurence. When I lowered it to 2.5 mg the side effect completely went away. Now I feel great and the schizophrenia is still gone. I recommend Zyprexa but the doctor has to be really careful with the dosage.",8,112,2

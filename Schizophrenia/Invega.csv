"Invega","123","June 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","NIGHTMARE! I do not recommend this drug. I was taking it for 6 weeks (3 weeks to get me on 900 mg and 3 weeks to get me off). Terrible vivid nightmares that seemed more real than reality. I was wondering if I am dreaming or is it real all the time. My mind was empty. My muscles were in pain, I couldn't properly move my body because of hard muscles. I had a feeling of being pregnant - smell and taste changed, I had contractions and I produced milk. Only when this happened doctors decided to put me off that drug. Thank God for body side effects, because doctors don't take serious when you tell them that a drug is bad for mind, emotions etc.",1,2,1

They soon broke in and carted me to the mental hospital. After giving my story to the dr I was put on Invega shots and told I was skitz, I'd never felt it, after 3 months started having tremors, constant anxiety, panic  feeling of heart attack, couldn't move walk and 6 months on still on edge 24 hours a day.",2,1,1
"Invega","Pooh","May 3, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was taking clozaril for about 24 years. My doctor stopped my medicine and didn’t taper down. Instant stop. He then overdosed me on 256 mg of the shot. I had young emotions. No thought left. Couldn’t remember how to turn the key in my car. My legs started going up and down, face twitches. Forgot how to cook. Just could sit there and not move. My head started shaking. I stopped this drug but my mind never came back. I’m slowly losing love and emotion for life. If you love somebody don’t ever let them take invega. It is the worst drug on the market",2,2,1

I have noticed many side effects like muscle stiffness, agitation, involuntary movements horrific nightmares headaches and I have gained about 40 pounds in that time while continuing to exercise and eat healthily. I was on 9mg for about 3 months and then was lowered to 3mg. It did stop my severe psychosis when initially prescribed so for that I am very grateful. I am now weaning off the medication to hopefully improve my quality of life. Would not recommend unless absolutely necessary.",2,18,1
"Invega","DT","April 27, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Invega did work to keep me from relapsing into psychosis. Also the injection makes it ideal for people who might tend to forget or stop taking medication. I have had some minor issues like diminished sex drive (also times whenI couldn't produce any semen), blurry vision and weight gain. However, soon after taking this medication I developed a depression. My depression has varied from severe mental agony for entire days to its current more anhedonic state. It is debilitating to say the least. After holding on for five months I will try to switch back to Seroquel which in the past has left me more stable while also getting rid of any symptoms related to psychosis.  I am however not sure how much of the depression was caused by this medication.",4,9,1
"Invega","Fred","January 29, 2019","-","My wife was diagnosed schizophrenia and non-specific psychosis.  Hearing voices.. telling me I killed someone and as he was speaking to her from the corner of the room telling her where he was buried. Can't you see him right there? About 18 months of this and worse, a very dangerous situation.  Sectioned 8 times through 2018. A therapist helping me mentioned a client that would throw TV's through windows, fighting, hearing voices, seeing things.. Invega completely cured him.  My wife knew she needed help and tried Invega. Within a couple of hours of taking the pill she stopped hearing the voices, could read a book for the first time in years as she could finally focus. She is now taking shots along with the pills.  She is better than I could have ever imagined.   I couldn’t recommend Invega highly enough.  There are very few side effects and her head is clear.",10,15,1

I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and put on 3mg  and it took a little while for the delusions to end. I then fell into deep depression. I couldn't stand my head the way it was.  This drug blocked all my mind wandering that I loved so much.  I was given a 6 week course of ECT and put on 75mg dothepin antidepressant and invega upped to 6mg.  When the dose was increased to 6mg I had heart palpitations and couldn't sit still in a chair from stiff joints and was constantly falling asleep.   My psych blamed invega lowered my dose to 3mg and increased my dothepin to 150mg.  I was still robotic in thought and movement but I could lead a productive life.  My head did feel very dry and I was in survival mode though.  I started having 2000mg fish oil capsules a day and my thoughts became fluid and so did my joints and movement.  It's not a cure but I would recommend fish oil capsules to people with psychotic illness taking these meds.",8,27,1

Find a doctor that knows the walsh protocol. Using the The Walsh protocol you can put an end to your illness. Dr William Walsh made the protocol, and it has become widespread in the UK, Ireland and Australia.

I have been on Invega for a little less than 2 years now and I can with absolute confidence ascertain that it has done nothing for me. Aside from the decrease in sexual appetite and libido, difficulty having and maintaining erections, little to no ejaculatory fluid (which is really frustrating btw), the muscle tremors I am experiencing, and the 30 pounds I have gained since starting this medication , it is with no doubt an absolute and total waste of money.

Restarted risperidone and feel good again. It must work for some people but not for me. No data anywhere comparing Invega to risperidone which is odd because the drugs are related.

When I first received the shot, it felt like my brain was about to explode. I had extremely high blood pressure on this medicine- 178/105. After I stopped it, my blood pressure is 110/78. I experienced temporal lobe damage from this medicine and a CT scan showed atrophy of my brain after I stopped taking it. Be careful- many psychiatrists receive grants and stipends from big pharma and receive extra insurance money to peddle more drugs to as many patients as possible.

I find that it is good as it gives less severed side effect as the medication in our body at a constant level.

"Invega","Anonymous","February 1, 2008","-","This drug works great for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has made me feel a ton better, and its benefits far outweigh the few side effects. Be sure to take exactly when you are supposed to and not try to catch up on a dose. I did this and had to go to the hospital for treatment of muscle rigidity and uncontrollable muscle spasms, but as I said it has only happened once and happened when I missed a dose and tried to double up. So this is a great medicine, but take as prescribed only.",0,112,3

"Risperdal","puppylove","February 20, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was admitted to the hospital and prescribed Risperdal. I recently went from 3mg to 2mg. I've been having really bad swallowing issues on this med and we're hoping the lower dose helps with this. Otherwise a great medicine for me I've been active in the community and able to control some of my unusual thoughts. I would recommend this medication, but be cautious of the side effects. I've been on the med for 2 years now. I gained 40lbs and remarkably I was able to lose 50lbs since starting Risperdal.",7,11,1
"Risperdal","Learning","July 29, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I started out on 1 mg and went all the way up to 4 mg then all the way back down to 1 mg again. Currently staying at 1 mg in order to have semi normal cognitive function. When I went up to 4 mg. I was catatonic for 6 months until the dose got lowered down to 1 mg. Everyone is different but felt like it shut my whole brain down the bad AND the good. Good luck.",4,16,1
"Risperdal","Jace","May 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have Psychosis NOS  (Not Otherwise Specified)  and I am currently taking 2 mg. once daily. My temperament is better. I am not as easily agitated and sleep better at night. Prior to Respirdal I had severe insomnia and was easily moved to anger. On the down side I gained 20 lbs in about 2 months, my affect is flat and my energy level is very low. I force myself to exercise but I seem to be experiencing muscle tiredness and some coordination problems. I plan to speak w/ my doctor for med adjustment.",0,23,1
"Risperdal","Hef","April 12, 2019","-","I was forced to end taking haldol 2.5 mg/night after 27 1/2 years -over 10000 days- because they stopped making it. I was prescribed risperdal. I started at 2mg a day and they reduced the dosage to 1 mg. I also stopped cogentin and Prozac because of strong discomfort. After around 40-50 days of risperdal I didn't sleep as well and felt utterly horrible like a zombie- like it was torturing and destroying my brain. I came to my senses and rid myself of all medication whatsoever since it seemed to be harming my brain and not helping me sleep and have recovered from all mental illness in about 5 days and am getting somewhat less sleep but feel a lot better overall. So the medicine was good in that it convinced me to get rid of it and all medication and completely recover. I believe people who take risperdal should be reviewed after 30-50 days or so and given the option to stop taking it and maybe all medication if they have horrible zombie like side effects like I did.",3,24,1
"Risperdal","Anonymous","February 5, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This has helped a lot for my daughter's hallucinations. She was not diagnosed with schizophrenia, so her hallucinations are related to either her epilepsy or something else. There have been a couple of times where she stopped taking it because she felt better, but then the hallucinations would come back. She had to go on the highest dose after she stopped taking it the first time, so if you find this works for you or a loved one, just make sure they don't stop abruptly.",10,16,1
"Risperdal","Meh","January 19, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Just my experience, your mileage may vary. Odd tunnel vision as it takes effect. After about 2 weeks, expect your wife to be very  unsatisfied.  If your job involves mental math or coding, this will become much more challenging. It dulls your emotions even beyond what your horrible affliction will. I became an impotent robot with no processing power. The cure, at least for me, was worse than the disease. I have since learned to ignore, or at least recognize and not take them as absolute reality. Mental gymnastics and proper training are equally effective; the side effects of Respirdal are life altering in a bad way.",2,25,1
"Risperdal","COCOA","January 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My husband was just prescribed this however he is ALREADY drowsy, unmotivated  and gaining weight. I am looking for a better option for someone who has been hearing many voices for years??? Please help",0,4,1
"Risperdal","Hell yah","October 2, 2018","-","I got put on this medication for psychosis, delusions in  December of 2017. I started at 0.5mg and slowly raised to 3mg. So far, this is a decent drug. I feel like the way I was before my psychotic episodes began, and it's very nice. The downside is high prolactin levels and slight weight gain (roughly 10lbs). My doctor and I are in the process of getting off of it (currently at 2mg) but this drug did the trick to placate delusions. I would recommend but not for long term.",7,9,1
"Risperdal","Anonymous","August 3, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Was put on risperdal when first hospitalized and diagnosed with schizophrenia. Gained about 100 lbs in a year. Felt dull cognitively. Slept the majority of the day. No psychotic symptoms. Delusions and hallucinations gone. No agitation. No anxiety tremors.",5,12,1
"Risperdal","K-Man","July 24, 2018","-","I was prescribed Risperdal after voluntarily admitting myself into a psychiatric hospital in Connecticut back in '17. Risperdal was the first antipsychotic drug that I was administered during my stay, and while I did experience some relief from my anxiety, I would say that the side-effects were more negative than positive. Upon entering the hospital, I was aware of my surroundings and completely aware of reality. At time I was also unsure of my own diagnosis so it wasn't easy taking the Risperdal. I was officially diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and paranoid ideation. Upon release I found the side effects to be negative. I was sleeping the majority of the day at my house, and had a difficult time finding motivation to leave the house. Drug is incredibly powerful and while I think it can be used for very severe illnesses, I wouldn't recommend it until someone is thoroughly evaluated and the proper diagnosis is made.",1,15,1
"Risperdal","aw","July 17, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This is a life destroying drug.I have anger issues and this drug was mixed in my food by my family. I couldn't read a book, enjoy music or watch TV .My thought process became impaired.I suffered from the worst kind of akathisia, endlessly walking for seven months and had suicidal thoughts. I became drowsy, lost all motivation and couldn't care about anything. I was able to come off it after a great struggle and remained drug free for eleven years and was able to enjoy all the things I couldn't because of this drug. Unfortunately, however, my siblings have again mixed it in my food as I had to stay with them. All the side effects are back and life feels like a nightmare devoid of purpose again.",1,21,1
"Risperdal","FA","June 28, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","19 years old, using 2 ml instead of 3 1/2ml and actually  4 ml was  initially prescribed by a psychiatrist.  It was  because I was hearing voices and was paranoid and smoking marijuana almost every day for a period of 6 months.   I got  as side effects stiffness, spasms, trembling, increase in saliva, decrease in sexual ability.  I have been taking now 1 pill every other day until I don't take it anymore since the doctor said that I had to take it at least for a year without smoking to find out if the problem goes away.   I'm looking for another pill to control the these symptoms and I am not smoking or hearing voices anymore. Read all the comments but I do not constipate or gain weight. Since I lowered the dose I am more sociable, smile and confident but the spams worry me since they happen like 3 or 4 times a day.",6,7,1
"Risperdal","Charles120","June 22, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This medication saved my life. Been taking it for two years following two very difficult psychosis episodes and my brain is a mess without this medication. Without it, I have very weird and intrusive thoughts about the nature of reality. Paranoid thoughts are all but gone as well. The only side effect I noticed is weight gain, which I honestly don't mind.",10,14,1
"Risperdal","Eli White","May 15, 2018","-","I was forced into a Canadian mental hospital in the late 90s when I was 13 years old (I'm male by the way). They woke me up in bed and gave me a cup with pills and told me it was to help me with sleep. It was later on that they told me that the pills were risperdal. When I was on Respirdal I gained a lot of weight and was drowsy. I even developed minor gynecomastia that still remained 3 years later. I'm in my 30s now and the gynecomastia surgery isn't covered by any insurance companies. What was covered was the ultrasound and mammogram. I don't have the money to pay for the glandular breast tissue removal surgery. People notice my male breast growth and tell me that I have breasts. My doctor says my gynecomastia is noticeable when I take my shirt off. People who know me notice breast growth through my t shirt. Can the Canadian Government cover the cost of breast removal surgery if I am required to take antipsychotics that side effects are that grow breasts.",1,12,1
"Risperdal","Ashley Dwyer","May 6, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I find it helps in terms of what I wanted with the voices and all but the side effects make me very drowsy and tired and I can barely muster the energy to do anything in my day. My moods been pretty low or up and down too. I find myself to still have a slight paranoia of others. Even when I first starting the meds the first few times I believed I was being poisoned but I usually felt like everyone offering me drinks or food were trying to harm me so not really anything new there. That part has calmed down a fair bit. I hope one day they can find a way to completely rid me of this so I don't have to rely on medications all the time cause I sometimes forget to take them or  I can't find them on occasion. I'm glad I'm back on them though after I was initially told by the mental hospital that I'm not to have them anymore which mucked me up. I hope I'm not forced to stop again cause this is honestly my peace.",8,10,1
"Risperdal","Anonymous","May 5, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","It did nothing for my delusions and psychotic behavior. Made me gain 40 lbs in 2 months. I now have restless legs and arms that haven’t gone away even though I am not taking it anymore.",2,8,1
"Risperdal","Jess","April 20, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This drug did not react well with my body chemistry, but I didn't have any delusions on it or for 4 years afterward. I gained over 120 lbs in a year  and a few months on it. I slept about 14 hours a day. It made me apathetic, not a normal trait for me. I just didn't care about things. I stopped having my period and developed a lot of symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Oh, I had major carb cravings, like for fast food pizza, that I never usually have. I didn't feel like myself. I have been diagnosed with different things but believe I have major depression with psychotic features.",2,8,1
"Risperdal","kayraa","April 10, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was taking this medication to combat features of psychosis with my depression and PTSD. It made me start lactating and gain like 10 lbs. it worked well for my paranoia and nightmares though!",5,8,1

"Risperdal","Avoid this med at all cost","November 23, 2017","-","Three years of constipation on the meds just broke some mechanism related to bowel movements three years ago when I was on them, now on or off them now I don't go. I've read hundreds of other cases of this happening with this. I also have severe IBS from the meds and can't eat anything but fruit and vegetables without problems. Brain damage : I attempted to come of this med (risperdone) and tapered and still ended up with bad brain damage. I no longer have much in the way of thoughts or can think complex things, or higher processing, I can remember very little (I was incredibly smart before) this is the number one thing making me suicidal. I also can no longer feel what things evoke or derive enjoyment from many things. Severe sleep problems too.",0,15,1
"Risperdal","?????","October 8, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","This makes you restless after long term use. Good at controlling symptoms if you be patient with it. Ask your Dr to reduce dosage if you feel better after 3 years. Good Luck",7,15,1
"Risperdal","Charlotte9688","August 16, 2017","-","Risperdal has made my life manageable again. I suffer from PTSD and schizophrenia primarily with thought disorder (although I have hallucinated and heard voices). I used to scream in my sleep and thought everyone was trying to kill me. When I started risperdal the terrifying thoughts stopped and my behavior returned to normal. I take risperdal with a combination of gabapentin and zoloft. I now have a very good job and good relationships with my friends, family, and co-workers.  There are downsides to this drug such as weight gain. I gained a lot of weight the first two years I started taking risperdal. It is important to note that I have since lost a good bit of the weight I have gained.",8,22,1
"Risperdal","Donttakethismed","July 31, 2017","-","Please please do not take this drug it destroyed my life,once you take it you are completely dependant on it and trying to stop it can cause brain damage,It is the most horrific med.",1,23,1
"Risperdal","Lavenderr","July 16, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Please avoid this medication at all cost,it is impossible to get off. I have tried twice and ended up in total disaster.The first time I tried to get off it I end up completely constipated and three years later I am still badly constipated. It changed some mechanism responsible for that during withdrawal. The second time I tried to come off it I ended up with Anhedonia which Is an inability to enjoy things, when I look at food now it's like looking at a rock, no reaction. These drugs cause total dependancy, completely change the brain and cause brain damage and are not the answer. Please just see a shaman/healer and get an auric sweep and clear out the negative entities that cause schizophrenia. Its worked for thousands of years.",1,16,1
"Risperdal","HannaKK","March 21, 2017","-","I wish I could give Risperidal/Risperidone 0 stars. Worst medication I've ever had to take. Made me so exhausted despite getting 12 hours of sleep a night and made me gain 30lbs. This medication slapped the heart right out of me and I was a zombie, devoid of any emotion for months. I wouldn't slip this to my worst enemy.",1,21,1
"Risperdal","aria9671","March 20, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medicine helps with my schizophrenia, calms me down but that's about it. But the worst things about it are the freaking side effects! Look I took this medicine in first grade for irritability, took it again in middle school now I'm 20 and started back up again a few months ago..it makes me soooooo sleepy that I'm falling into things, I get severe panic attacks and I'm hungry as hell hence why I gained 11 lbs. Oh and I have this funny, unbearable feeling in my right leg and it's sooo uncomfortable omg! But on the other hand its not as bad as latuda or haldol but its worth it i guess",5,14,2

"Risperdal","HopelessAgain","December 14, 2016","-","I don't have schizophrenia I am undiagnosed. I was having issues with family and certain things in my life. Taking this meds made me feel worse with most of my symptoms. I had moments where I felt over tranquillized and trouble communicating how I really felt. I know I felt better before the medication. Now that I am off of it my list of negative side effects is quite large. I wouldn't reccomend this medication to anyone. Especially if you have an endless diagnosis in the first place. Be careful believing what your Drs say. They get all of their recommendations from pharmaceutical companies. Once I was off of this medication Drs. Refuse to listen to me. They just recommend I take it again or take other drugs. They refuse to admit their mistakes. They refuse to acknowledge anything.",1,29,2
"Risperdal","Anonymous vet","October 20, 2016","-","I started risperidone after my last hospitalization for PTSD with psychosis. Before risperidone I suffered from insomnia, nightmares, and paranoia that lead me to full blown psychotic state. I now live a more normal life with few symptoms. I take risperidone with sertraline and clonazepam at night then pass out for about 10 hours. I suffer from mental fog and lack of emotion on the drug. I don't fully wake up until about 4 pm after my afternoon nap. It has also caused my periods to stop and enlarged breasts that leak once I up'd to 2 mg. Going to try ziprazidone next to see if I can have better quality of life.",7,16,2

It has helped me control my impulses and stay on the right path. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia without paranoid thoughts. The paranoid thoughts only happen with street drugs. I still hear voices, but I seem to be managing them a lot better now. Both Halodol and Risperdal work extremely well for schizophrenia.",10,22,2
"Risperdal","BrittanyJ","June 16, 2015","-","I was prescribed risperdal for schizophrenia ages 12-16 around 10 years ago now and it's a huge reason as to how I was able to stay in public school. Other people still noticed I was different but it did wonders for both visual and auditory hallucinations, racing thoughts, and paranoia. It never could fully help my delusions though. I gained a bit of weight, but what ultimately led me to no longer take the medication was the zombifying effect it had and how I felt it changed my personality. Might be okay for others though.",7,25,2
"Risperdal","nostergaard","December 7, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have used Risperdal several times over the last few years. Originally, I was taking it for ruminating thoughts (I call it busy head) and difficulty sleeping. It definitely helped slow down my thoughts and allowed me to sleep better.  After my son was born, I was having some postpartum depression and went back on Risperdal.  It helped with the kindling and agitation, but I did gain about 10-15 pounds on it.  When I stopped the medication, the weight fell off.  Most recently, I'm using it as an adjunct therapy to Neurontin and Trileptal for agitation and anxiety. I have emetephobia and this has been the only thing that has allowed me to be around my phobia and not have a panic attack and an ER visit.  I do not like the weight gain.",8,22,2

One day I felt an explosion in my head, after that I started hearing voices and became really paranoid. I finally admitted that I needed help, after seeing that I coudn't hold a job, snapped at people, starting fights with people for no reason, insane thoughts and a brain I couldn't control, I was prescribed Risperdal for schizophrenia, Ativan for anxiety, and benzotropine for side affects, all these medications for what my kind doctor called a brain disorder. Stopped paranoid thoughts, delusions, gained social skills back. No libido, 15 lbs weight gain in month, But feel sane again. Seems to work for 7 hours, then paranoid again.",9,80,2
"Risperdal","My Lovely Son","September 14, 2011","-","My son had severe acute psychosis and possible diagnosis of schizophrenia at age 17.  Risperdal (Risperidone) brought him back to his normal self, for the most part.  He has put on weight (2 trouser sizes bigger) and he is inclined to rock back and forth a little, when seated.  He is slightly less motivated and says he doesn't retain information as he used to at school.  This may be improved by adjusting the dose.  But this medicine gave me my son back and seems well-tolerated by him.  The psychosis is completely gone.",9,66,2

Now he decides he doesn't need it anymore. Well the voices are totally out of control. He can't even hear me when I talk to him, because the voices are so loud. He doesn't sleep, he talks constantly to them. I just wish he would take the medicines. We've been dealing with this for 17 years, so I do know that this medication works to quieten the voices.",8,69,2

Since I have been on Risperdal I have had a significant decrease in the voices to where they are almost gone.  If I don't get any sleep or I am really stressed out the voices come back, so I try to get plenty of sleep and avoid stressful situations.  I give Risperdal an A .  The first week on Risperdal I was extremely sleepy.  It was really hard to wake up, but now I am fine and my body has adapted to the medication.  You should try it.  The peace of mind I get from Risperdal is priceless.  I used to think my thoughts were being broadcast out loud and now my own thoughts are much quieter.",10,130,2

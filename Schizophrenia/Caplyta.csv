"Caplyta","KASG820","June 11, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I just took my first dose  of Caplyta for my Bipolar II last night and  I woke up feeling awful. Dizzy, headache and nausea. I’ve been on my couch all day. When I get up I’m extremely dizzy. I called my doctor and he said to skip tonight’s dose and have a day off of the medication, then take it the next day with dinner. I’m hoping I feel better tomorrow. I’m scared to take another dose.  I was hopeful about this new medicine. I was on Vraylar for about 6 months and felt great on it, but had to come off of it because I gained 40 pounds.",1,0,1
"Caplyta","Poconos","June 11, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I'm diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar 1,  I'm already taking a lot of meds.  On this page I found that I shouldn't be taking this drug if I was also taking mental illness meds, overactive bladder meds,  or allergy meds. I did not know any of this before taking this med. I was on it for a week and 1/2 and I felt completely horrible, zombie-like, completely out of it, with diarrhea, no sleep.  I stopped taking it yesterday and I feel so much better.",1,1,1

"Clozapine","Bear","August 15, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","If it wasn't for clozapine I would be in a secure hospital or dead. I  have epilepsy and inter-ictal psychosis organic. My seizures are controlled by topiramate. Age 19 I had a lot of seizures which left me afterwards  very pyschotically unwell. Had anti pyschotics. None worked. It was thought at the time I would  never be well enough to live in the community. Clozapine was tried as a last resort and though initially I had a high heart beat and some drooling. It all settled down. Fairly soon. I was on topiramate initially at 450 mg alongside clozapine. It was working and six weeks later I was discharged from hospital.  I accept I will always have to be on it. As  on two occasions tried to come off and became psychotic again. I  am on 325 mg 25mg day and 300 night alongside topiramate. I am under a neurologist and  psychiatrist. I get regular health checks don't smoke or drink. I don't know what I would do without clozapine.",10,15,1
"Clozapine","Mom","July 29, 2019","-","My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 17. He was even hospitalized for 3 and 1/2 months because of this horrible disease.  He tried many different medicines and none worked until clozapine. Clozapine helped him a lot with the voices but the weight gain is horrible. He gained over 100lbs in 6 months! Now he is depressed and won’t leave the house because of his sudden weight gain and is refusing taking the med because of it so now we are back to square one. It’s a no win situation /: feeling helpless.",6,15,1
"Clozapine","Alexis","June 10, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","<b>Clozaril (clozapine):</b>			 My brother was also lucky to be on Clozaril. I was watching a news report on the drug on TV one day. It stated that it brought people back who had Schizophrenia. It gave high percentages and stated that they were even able to carry a job. I spoke with my Mother and she worked to get this drug for him. He was so normal on it, like he woke up and was himself again. He was able to live in an apartment and work a 40 hour job. On his off hours, he joined a band and played trumpet on some evenings and weekends in clubs and restaurants. He was able to go out on dates. He wanted to complete his degree in music. How wonderful it was for him to have a real life to enjoy.",0,49,1

Increased depression. OMG the horrifying facial ticks  and the Dr won't do a thing. Sleeps his life away. Developed GERD as well. I personally believe this drug is harming him.",1,16,1

Went to lots of docs, given a lot of meds, allergy and asthma, anti depressant and anti anxiety. Of course it was classic schizophrenia prodrome, no one bothered to say he was high risk for psychosis.

"Clozapine","Invis","January 22, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Posted a review on Olanzapine  on 2017-01-12 (2 years ago) on this site w/same name (Invis). Got switched to Clozapine; first dose was Dec 13, 2017; 12.5mg. I am now on 275mg a night. What a life saver, I wish I took this to begin with as I strongly believe voices would be 100% gone by now, anyway, they are pretty much there 5-15% of the time now. Blood tests aren't an issue for me. Used to it now but shoulder area of shirt and pillow are pretty wet in the morning from drooling. Weight is now 200-205 lbs, won't budge even from treadmill fast walking 20 mins/day and pants size is now 38 from 30-32 lol. All of these are small prices to pay for being healthy again. 10/10",10,12,1
"Clozapine","Dmom","November 10, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","My son starting showing signs of psychosis right after his 14th bday.  Diagnosed with schizophrenia 6 months later.  He was in a constant state of his own reality and heard voices on a regular basis.  Seroqel, Zyprexa, Invega, and Ability did nothing for him.  His psychiatrist prescribed Clozapine as a last resort.  I won't allow his dosage any higher than 300mg per day for now since the side effects worry me.  This drug has been a lifesaver to allow him to participate in the regular world and quiet the voices where he can focus on real ppl.  It makes him drowsy so he takes it at night.  Weight gain is significant but most antipsychotics will do this. Regular blood monitoring to make sure his WBC stays normal.  So good, so far.",8,21,1

"Clozapine","LastResort","April 26, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","After trying many AP's, Clozapine finally settled my Schizoaffective/Schizophenia symptoms. Has a number of side effects, noticably, moderate OCD, temporary stiffness in joints and some initial weight gain. After 10 years, about to swap over to a new drug called Reluxta, which is now on Australian PBS list for AUD$40 (previously AUD$1700). Reluxta is suitable for those coming off Clozapine (slowly), with usually better results &amp; fewer side effects. Some patients may still need to take a reduced Clozapine amount, while taking Reluxta as the main AP.",9,5,1
"Clozapine","Chris Michelle","April 24, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","This drug almost killed me.  My white cell count was so low, I was getting fevers every other day and I had severe diarrhea for almost a full year.  When I finally sought medical help no one could help me.  I asked to stop the drug and I slowly got better.  As much as this drug is praised, it is unnecessarily overprescribed.  In some European countries it is banned,  and for good reason.  My quality of life was horrible on this drug.  Gained weight,  constipated once for a whole week,  I could not find a good job,  and developed extreme OCD that dissipated as soon as drug was stopped.  I do not recommend. You are better off turning to your local charity organization for help than getting involved with any doctor that willingly prescribes this without properly assessing your situation.  Good luck.",3,10,1

"Clozapine","resilient Nicole","January 26, 2018","-","My daughter has schizophrenia since 19 years old and had first gone thru most of the other medications, which did not work well, she even attempted suicide.  Finally she was put on Clozapine, which helped her so much that she even managed to graduate with a BA.  There are negative side effects such as constipation, weight gain (which she is fighting successfully with Weight Watchers), and her voices do break thru once in a while and some psychosis sometimes.  But she is incredibly resilient.  All in all, clozapine is to her like a wonder drug.  Hopefully better medications will arrive in the future.",8,12,1
"Clozapine","shahnila fahmi","January 22, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I am using Clozapine 1 mg from last three years coz I am suffering from auditory hallucination from 2010 till now. I am under treatment and my doctor is saying I will have to take medicines whole life and there is no permanent solution. If any doctor knows any permanent solution please contact me. Clozapine is not for supressing negative voices but is used to calm you and relax you and reduce stress and help you to sleep better. For Visual and auditory hallucination , Respiridone 1 mg is useful daily but Clozapine and Respiridone  increase your weight too much. In my case, my weight increased from 45 kg to 67 kg in just three years.",0,7,1

I went on invega  and then Risperidone but they both made me feel like a zombie because I had to be on the highest dose. I had akathisia and I was restless and tired at the same time and just wanted to sleep all day but physically couldn't  and very depressed. I would hear voices every night when it would wear off. I had intrusive thoughts also. My doctor suggested trying 250mg Clozapine but I was scared. It is a miracle drug! The outside voices went away and the thoughts that weren't my own! I have no side effects and I am happier now! After a year you only have to get your blood drawn once a month. Worth it to have my life back!",10,30,1

And it has made a big difference .The voices gradually are going away. He can actually sit and watch TV and have a conversation. He is enjoying things again.

"Clozapine","Anonymous","August 11, 2015","Taken for 2 to 5 years","My daughter was prescribed Clozaril as a last resort because I refused to allow her to be admitted to a state hospital. Every other med combination had been tried for 5 years during which she was constantly psychotic, in and out of the hospital. That was nearly 3 years ago and she improves in  tiny increments every day. We have learned a great deal during this 8 years: that most psychiatrists don't understand how to treat mental illness because most they don't believe in neurotransmission disorders. They really think behavioral health is about poor choices caused by emotional trauma. Clozaril is the only effective med and it is used as a last resort in the USA. The shame is that it is a front line gold standard med in Great Britain.",10,54,1

"Clozapine","Anonymous.","June 11, 2015","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This medication was absolutely terrible. I couldn't think and everyone had to repeat things all the time. Also I extreme weight gain in barely any time. I always wanted to eat something unhealthy when I walked by somewhere and I had never had that before I was on this medication, at least not as badly as that. In the past I had gradual weight gain but this was rapid.  It is also bad for the fact that it gave me seizures twice and I ended up breaking my ankles and they put me on Epival which causes birth defects. Hopefully everything will be better though. I'm on Invega now and it already is better and I don't need clozapine even though the doctors were trying to make me believe it was the only medication that works when it isn't.",2,24,2

He loaded me up on benzos and SSRIs. It was like dumping gas on the fire. I was so fed up that I switched doctors when I went to college. I've been with him for 3 years now. He did everything he could think of. Some things didn't work, some were incomplete, and some caused horrible side effects. So last ditch he wrote Clozaril. I feel wonderful.

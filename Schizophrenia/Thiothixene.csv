"Thiothixene","Anonymous","June 9, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Navane (thiothixene):</b>			 My wife was on Navane for schizophrenia for over 20 years and it worked great. She used such as small dosage (5mgs) that she never experienced side effects. However, Pfizer quit making it and now she's on Seroquel, which is not very effective. She had 2 bad episodes since on it. I hear another company is supposed to be making it again and it will be available in late 2019.",0,7,1

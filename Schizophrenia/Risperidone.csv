It did make my paranoia really bad for a week but apart from that I was starting to feel okay again. I had to stop as I started to lactate and as a 20 year old I found it quite distressing so I was swapped to aripiprazole, I hope this one works as well as risperidone did!",8,1,1

I was hearing things and seeing things and completely lost my mind and was admitted and this is what they put me on! At the time it saved my life and made me feel normal again! But as time went on I noticed I didn’t get excited about anything anymore I had no emotions! I gained a lot of weight I went from 150-210lbs. I stopped having periods. It made me have the worst anxiety ever. I’m currently weaning myself off of it! Come to find out I had an over active thyroid and had radiation done and was told I can come off this medicine! So it was my thyroid that made me go crazy and put on this medicine! I’m glad to say I’m coming off of it! I’m ready to enjoy life and have my feelings back! Hope this helps someone!",5,10,1

I loved going for walks, when I was in London I’d go out. I was in bliss. Suddenly I’m sinking... it’s helping me so much by removing psychotic thoughts (all gone) yet it’s ruining my happiness.

I’ve lost interest in movies, music, studies and sports. Has anyone felt so tired on it? Has anyone been sprawled on bed like me the whole day doing nothing?",3,7,1

"Risperidone","peter","January 4, 2020","-","The problem with this medicine is that while it is supposed to treat depression and works wonders to remove hallucinations and unwanted thoughts (some, at least), it makes one so tired and lazy that one becomes depressed in the process of being so tired! This is truly a conundrum. It made me extremely demotivated as I lost all interest in movies, exercise and study.  Yes, the benefits of Risperidone are immense but I would not go so far as to say that they outweigh the side effects. The side effects are lethal. They hit right at the body and mind, and that is a big problem. Not to mention the weight gain that occurs because of inactivity and excess sleep. I find it really hard to shave in the morning! My mornings are the worst. I just can't get out of bed.  Yes, it makes one sleep VERY well. There is no doubt about that, yet it is the TIREDNESS which is a big problem. I don't know why drug companies can't figure out a way to make a medicine that does not have such side effects.",1,2,1

I came to my senses and rid myself of all medication whatsoever since it seemed to be harming my brain and not helping me sleep and have recovered from all mental illness in about 5 days and am getting somewhat less sleep but feel a lot better overall. So the medicine was good in that it convinced me to get rid of it and all medication and completely recover.

Upon entering the hospital, I was aware of my surroundings and completely aware of reality. At time I was also unsure of my own diagnosis so it wasn't easy taking the Risperdal. I was officially diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder and paranoid ideation. Upon release I found the side effects to be negative. I was sleeping the majority of the day at my house, and had a difficult time finding motivation to leave the house.

Look I took this medicine in first grade for irritability, took it again in middle school now I'm 20 and started back up again a few months ago..it makes me soooooo sleepy that I'm falling into things, I get severe panic attacks and I'm hungry as hell hence why I gained 11 lbs. Oh and I have this funny, unbearable feeling in my right leg and it's sooo uncomfortable omg! But on the other hand its not as bad as latuda or haldol but its worth it i guess",0,14,3

Those 10 years were horrific and prior to diagnoses the situation got so much worse that the last option, which was staring us in the eye, was to institutionalize her. Me and my siblings faced a very turbulent childhood, it was a roller-coaster ride. But this drug changed everything to the point of disbelief. My mum has changed from a lunatic to a stereotypical, traditional, loving mom. The effects of the drug were instant- within a month. The dosage is 1ml in the morning and 2ml in the night-  we mix it in her food or drinks.",10,15,3

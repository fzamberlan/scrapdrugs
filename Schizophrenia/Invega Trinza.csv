"Invega Trinza","Personnumber4","October 24, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","On Invega Trinza and paranoia has gone. Absolutely love the convenience of only having to take it once every 3 months! Some pain at injection site but only lasts a day or two. Unfortunately I have started lactating and am not sure if I should stay on it because of this side effect.  I do sleep a lot and eat a lot on this medication but it's so much better than when I'm not on it and have to deal with schizophrenic symptoms",9,2,1

"Invega Trinza","anongirl","April 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I have been on this injection since 2017. Received the monthly injections for about three months before my doctor noticed my remarkable stability in mood and made the switch to the tri-monthly injection. When switched to the tri-monthly injection, I noticed that in the third month of being on it, my symptoms of paranoia and delusions would flare up. I've learned to live with it. However, my sex drive is completely gone and my menstrual cycle is TOO light. As well, there are nights that my insomnia flares up. Have not gained any weight but I haven't lost any either.  To counter all the bad side effects, I have to say that this is the longest that I have been out of the hospital. Besides the odd paranoia/delusions in the third month, I don't hear any voices like I used to or experience a full-blown manic episode (diagnosis is schizoaffective with bipolar tendencies).",6,7,1
"Invega Trinza","TREVICTABOY","March 19, 2019","-","Hey guys I am Geriboy from Hungary so from Europe.  Since 2017 I have been diagnosed with  paranoid schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. I am on INVEGA TRINZA 525MG  which in Hungary is called TREVICTA, it got rid of all my symptoms.  I really would recommend this drug for every one. Pills are bad for me but this Depot Injection only 4 times a year is a magic! I really like it. Very clear head, I am focused, I can meet my friends and not sleeping to much during the day. It also removed also my suicide thinking   which is very important with Psychosis! Since getting this drug I want to live more and more:) so its really helpful :) Thx for my new pdoc :) For sleep I have been taking 20mg Olanzapine Teva and 2mg Rivotril.",10,5,1
"Invega Trinza","turtle","March 14, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I been on invega trinza for almost four years for my schizophrenia. The first side effect I had was weight gain over 70pds. I stopped having my period due to high prolactin. I also found out I have high triglycerides, high cholesterol, and low white blood cell count. I have schizophrenia so I do need this medicine. But seriously weighing the side effects I have against the mental stability I have.",0,8,1
"Invega Trinza","Tim","October 12, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I was on Invega sustena for over a year before being on Trinza.  I was committed to the hospital about two years ago and was resistant to taking medication.  I did allow them to give me a shot not knowing what it was at the time.  Within a month my delusions cleared up and I stopped having auditory or visual hallucinations.  At first I gained a little weight but after switching to a vegan diet I lost a total of 40lbs without any extra exercise.  I've held down a steady job and have not had a manic episode since I've been taking the shot.  Today my arm is a little sore as I got the shot yesterday but it's a small price to pay for keeping me sane.  I would highly recommend this drug to anyone that has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.",10,13,1
"Invega Trinza","Lee","August 22, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Taken for almost three years, this drug is awful if your wanting to work, the impaired thinking and the sleepiness make it absolutely hard to work in any workplace. Only try this as a last resort.",2,13,1
"Invega Trinza","dunno","April 12, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I'm on Invega Trinza for Schizophrenia and It's not bad. I can function somewhat well, but the problem are the side effects such as no sex drive, anhedonia, and no emotions. This is really hard to deal with, but I can't go off it anymore because I already tried and got another psychotic episode.",5,4,1
"Invega Trinza","Brolo","February 22, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This drug is the worst thing that has happened to me. At first I was over medicated this drug caused my tongue to tic the upper part of my mouth. I would have all sorts of hallucinations and delusions which have gradually gone away as the medicine has been reduced to the recommended dose. Not only to mention I was only experiencing delusions prior to medication. They have gone away now but it seems as though my thoughts echo mimic align with sounds I hear. Also, it feels as though there are bugs under my skin due to micro muscle spasm. Worst part about this drug is that it causes you to zone into things like stare at things or become immobile in your line of vision. Which this only happens occasionally it really is difficult to drive or hold down a job. I have heightened energy level with adding Abilify. As this Invega Trinza causes couch lock not no energy, no motivation, and no drive. At least on this medication I don’t experience sexual dysfunction.",1,9,1
"Invega Trinza","Wolfleo","May 26, 2017","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Trinza and Invega Sustenna have been the only medication that has worked for me. I had almost no symptoms for a year which was great. I don't know if my schizophrenia is getting stronger or if the medication is losing its effectiveness. I had to add a second antipsychotic (Latuda 40 mg) to manage the emerging voices and delusions. I'm giving this a 9 because it gave me the year I needed to put myself back together to be ready. The side effects I've had were only pacing back and forth and shaking my leg.",9,5,1

No emotions also, I'm an hollow empty shell, a zombie. Can't get drunk. Took my life away. But to say something good, it helped with delusions. I think it is too much price for it.",1,16,1

"Invega Trinza","John2504","June 2, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was on invega sustenna for a little over a year then switched to invega trinza. I'm doing way better than I was. I'm off all my pills and just take the once every 3 month shot. I'm still disabled but the medicine helps relieve the symptoms.. I would recommend this to anyone who's already been on invega and invega sustenna.. It can't take your disability away but it can help you..",10,23,1

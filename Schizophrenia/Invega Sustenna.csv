"Invega Sustenna","Rose","April 29, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Taking this drug invega sustenna helped a bit with my schizophrenia symptoms. The side effects on the other hand were something else. I was significantly slowed down both mentally and physically. I did lose about 5 pounds and lost interest in food most probably due to feeling really depressed about my condition. I also couldn’t stop walking about, I couldn’t sit still anywhere for up to 2 mins. I also had abnormal muscle movements, my vision became really bad and blurry and I was drowsy all the time especially after taking a dose.",3,0,1
"Invega Sustenna","Bob","February 25, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I don't feel much on this medication.  It takes away the pleasure of enjoying things like video games sadly.  I've lost my sense of smell while on this drug.  I've gained the most weight I have compared to other antipsychotics.  I tried coming off it for a month with no success, it's really strong on preventing delusions and hearing voices.  I can't ejaculate or feel much sexual pleasure while on this medication.",5,7,1

I am 43 years old and i need my beauty sleep! I never want to feel the feeling of being awake for weeks on end!

"Invega Sustenna","divyanchris296","November 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Bad drug, it increases prolactin level's by a lot, in fact this drug ranks among the highest drugs that increase serum prolactin levels, and massive increase in prolactin levels reduces your testosterone by a hand full, don't expect to have a baby while on this medication. Don't expect an erection, Don't even bother with sex drive, that's for losers anyway. A massive decrease in libido. In short, this drug among a few other anti-psychotics will leave you feeling like a mix between a two year boy and a two year old girl.",1,17,1
"Invega Sustenna","BlkGirlLost","October 30, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","The one positive effect of this drug (InVega Sustenna 150 mg every 4 weeks) is that it controls my hallucinations and delusions.  But the trade off is really hard to bear.  I’ve lost all the joy in my life, the anhedonia is so bad that I have to live in a constant state of pretending to be happy because I am now unable to feel any kind of happiness or pleasure especially from activities I once enjoyed very much.  I can’t recall things and my memories have evaporated.  I feel blunted and flat all the time.  I can’t function in a meaningful way, and feel more depressed than I ever have in my life.  I’ve gained lots of weight, lost muscle tone yet I feel agitated like I want to jump out of my skin all the time.  Being on this medication is a living nightmare.  I am 43 and feel like life has come to a screeching halt.",3,22,1
"Invega Sustenna","Remi","October 14, 2019","-","I took 6 injections over a 6 month period. I didn't notice much in the first couple of months. It helped with the paranoia, I still heard voices to a lesser extent. Around the 5th month, I had noticed I gained 50 lbs (115 to 165) It happened so rapidly. I also began to lactate. That was all horrible but the worst of it was the severe anhedonia. They wanted to slowly taper me off the injection but I refused to take any more after the 6 month period. I felt mentally slower. I got no pleasure from listening to music, or watching TV. I stopped laughing. This is just my personal experience, but if you look up this medicine you will find there are many people that have gone through a similar experience.  It's been 14 months since my last injection and I think I have mentally fully recovered. I think this drug is too potent. I am almost certain it gave me some sort of brain damage. One of the biggest regrets of my life is taking this drug, I was better off before.",1,28,1

"Invega Sustenna","E","May 17, 2019","-","Worst experience of my life. I can't describe all of the side effects I had on invega Sustenna in 1000 characters, but my mind was disturbingly blank on this medication. It was as if all of my conscious thoughts were gone. I gained 25 pounds even though I just got the initial dose &amp; lost muscle. My delusions did go away so it worked for that, but it felt like it was because my thoughts stopped. I've gotten 4 sprains and one pulled muscle since I got injected with this poison at the end of August last year. My skin started flaking off and and my hair was falling out. I couldn't feel any emotions. I was unable to orgasm for the first month. There were more side effects, &amp; I don't think I fully conveyed the desperation I felt on this medication. I would like to let people who have gotten on it &amp; hate it that there is hope &amp; you will get better - once you are off it",1,31,1

"Invega Sustenna","saep62393","May 7, 2019","-","I've been on this drug/medicine for about two years and it has caused a lot of problems in my life. It barely helped with the auditory hallucinations such as the voices and paranoia. I feel like a zombie all the time, really tired, drained of energy, and like my brain is slowed down. I've had little to no sex drive (Sexual Dysfunction) and have no pleasure from sex. Within the first couple weeks of getting the injection of invega sustenna every month. I get muscle stiffness in my neck, arms, and hands. I feel like I can't breathe along with a rapid heart beat and a fever. I become confused, unable to function, dizzy, and lightheaded. This happens two to three times a month within a few weeks after getting the injection. I believe it might be because of NMS  (neuroleptic malignant syndrome) which is a rare side effect of the drug/medicine which might cause death. This is a horrible drug/medicine for me iIm going to try a different medicine from a different doctor and hope for the best.",3,17,1

"Invega Sustenna","bd1","December 15, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","If I could rate this medication a 0, I would. Going on this medication was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. I have bipolar I disorder and suffered a severe manic episode that didn’t respond to Seroquel or Risperdal. The psychiatrist prescribed me Invega and while it got rid of my mania and psychosis, it completely altered my personality. I had absolutely no emotion at all. I did not feel any sort of joy or happiness. Not to mention I gained at least 20pounds (I’m a very active 24 year old). The suicidal thoughts were so severe that I needed to be hospitalized. The absolute worst part is that even when you stop Invega, it stays in your system for months. It has an extremely long half life. If you want to be a zombie and lose interest in everything you ever loved, then take this medicine. If you’d like to be a productive member of society, avoid this medication at all costs. Find another medicine.",1,34,1
"Invega Sustenna","Anonymous","December 14, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I started taking this medication as a monthly injection  for Hearing voices/ paranoia and I took it for about 6 months. It made me gain 40lbs, I lost all sex drive, my mind became foggy and I felt mentally slower. I also got severe anhedonia and became unable to feel the effects of alcohol, cigarettes. I don't recommend this medication to anyone.. I've been off it for 4 months and am still dealing with the side effects of this medication. I will say that it did reduce the voices significantly but only because it's such a powerful mind numbing drug. I would advise to try something else if you really need a medication. Basically a chemical lobotomy.",2,20,1

Recently though, the paranoia a slight delusions have started to creep back into my mind. My psychiatrist upped my dose to 234 mg and now I can't stop eating and I'm hungry all the time. I already had a binge eating disorder but now it's infinitely worse. Also, the newer symptoms are still there. We're currently trying metformin to help with my appetite but so far it's doing absolutely nothing. I'm now thinking that I want to try switching to ziprasidone. It's supposed to be really good with weight management, but I'm worried it might not be as effective with my mental symptoms? I can't freak out because I'm working and going to school now. Back to invega though, I guess I can thank this medication for giving me my life back and making it so I can function in society. But I can't handle the weight gain...",0,5,1
"Invega Sustenna","kodein","September 30, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Gained over 30 lbs on this medication even though I'm eating less and I've cut out sugar from my diet. What's even more depressing is that even though I'm heavier I'm actually weaker than I've been when I was skinny and off meds. Also when I skip my injection for a week I'm hitting threes and long two's like it's nothing on the basketball court, while on the medication there's no point in going to the court. Also the results of treatment are suboptimal: I don't have friends, during 6 years of treatment I've never been on a date (which probably also has something to do with poor sexual functioning while on the medication), I stay at home all the time, am unemployed and gained the status of a disabled person. However when on the medication I don't have positive symptoms like thought broadcasting. I'm seriously considering switching the medication, I'm depressed, desperate, feel awful all the time and can't do it anymore.",3,14,2

So you have to couple your taking of available meds and therapy.  You have to change the way your mind works and thinks.

Fish oil, good sleep, eat healthy and exercise every other day.  Look after yourself and work your thought life out.  I have schizophrenia, Bi-Polar and depression and hold 2 small businesses that I run for most of my work-week (Music Studio owner operator and Stock Market Trader)  I've had schizophrenia for 14 years and for 7 of those years ran a highly successful business where I used to live (talking 7 figures)   EAT healthy!

So they adjusted my dose twice &amp; now I am feeling a bit better. Not a lot better though I would say.

I think that it depends on who you are around to make you feel depressed you have to keep in mind that it's a serious disease but with medication it can be manageable.

The voices are dulled down to the point of single sentences and like only 1-4 times a day so it's a lot more managable in day to day life. Started on sustenna, went on the tablets and now on Trinza.

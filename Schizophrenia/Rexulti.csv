"Rexulti","No name","May 29, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","This medication didn't work for me. I was totally out of my head with  Schizophrenia with in 2 weeks of changing to the Rexulti.  I'll never go back on this one.",1,2,1
"Rexulti","SAJ","May 17, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have had to opposite experience than others on this site. I was on Abilify for about 10 years after trying every 2nd gen anti psychotic. I also have Trauma PTSD. Anyway at some point abilify stopped working well and I became extremely manic and aggressive. I completely stopped sleeping. Honestly just stayed up all night sitting in a chair being weird and catatonic with racing thoughts. When I rarely fell asleep it would only be for a couple hrs. Dr. switched me to Rexulti because of studies showing it helps with PTSD and within 3 days I felt so so much better. I was less paranoid, less agitated, no voices, no paralysis, no EPS. Way better than Abilify ever was. I also started to sleep 6-8 hrs straight every night. It is like it just reset something in my brain and I began to sleep again. I guess it either really works for you or really doesn't.",10,4,1
"Rexulti","Nsjsn","March 18, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Please do NOT take this medication  Rexulti it will make you feel horrid and inhuman and it doesn't stop. I was given it for Schizoaffective disorder.  Be ready to be in pain.  It has been a solid week now of no rexulti and I still feel like I'm on it and can't escape this nightmare.",1,3,1
"Rexulti","Kaya","December 4, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This drug has almost completely halted all hallucinations (I have Schizoaffective disorder). To my knowledge I am not delusional and I seem to be able to follow conversations better. I have tried 5 other antipsychotics and none were even half as effective. Also I HAVE NO SIDE EFFECTS!!!! 6 months in and I will never go off. 4mg daily",10,17,1
"Rexulti","Pes","August 28, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been taking Rexulti for a 3-4 weeks. I'm a bit cranky all the time, always moody. But the PTSD has gone, and I'm thinking clearer. I still have anxious thoughts but they have always been there. My paranoia is controlled by CBT and reiterating soothing thoughts. I feel more motivated to study and procrastinate less. I have more hours in a day because I can wake up at 5am.",0,17,1
"Rexulti","Shell","July 4, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My daughter was taking abilify for 6 yrs and they switched her to this drug Rexulti because they said it had less weight gain issues.  At first it work great for about 8 weeks then just stopped working. She developed hiccups on and off with this med and her body temperature was going hit and cold she then became very confused and could not focus then extremely depressed and I took her to the emergency room where 16 hrs later she had a grand mal seizure. Don’t take this Med I don’t think they’ve done enough research on it and it is still to new. My daughter was in the hospital 2 1/2 weeks and still is unable to think properly or focus on anything and still experiencing hiccups on and off now. I hope and pray she recovers. She was in college getting straight A’s before this.",1,30,1
"Rexulti","Saysay","May 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on zyprexa for 9 years no issues them. I had Tardive dyskinesia . I was put on rexulti it worked for about a month got me out of the withdrawals of zyprexa but the rexulti gave me hot flashes every night so bad I had panic attacks on top of it I had extremely angry outburst for no reason I also had self harm behaviors during the outbursts. I stopped the medication as soon as I realized what it was doing to me. This is a scary medication",1,14,1
"Rexulti","June","March 19, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Go ahead and take this medicine if want to mentally feel better but be prepared to gain 30 pounds and never be able to lose it. Honestly, I don't recommend it at all because the weight gain has ruined my life. Good luck in whatever you decide to do.",5,29,1
"Rexulti","D","December 26, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I have tried this drug twice.  Both times it has caused auditory hallucinations.  When I discontinued,they stopped.",1,11,1
"Rexulti","Jylo","December 11, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Since starting Rexulti a week &amp; a half ago I've been feeling more motivated, I have more energy &amp; I feel less irritable. I'm studying more productively. I haven't been experiencing intrusive thoughts - obviously I can remember what they were, therefore they still enter my mind, but they're not distressing &amp; they don't linger. So, ultimately I feel 'normal' again i.e. without illness or side effects. (I'm still overweight &amp; I still procrastinate, but since beginning this new treatment I have the motivation &amp; energy to transform to the person I want to be).",8,27,1
"Rexulti","Sarah","November 27, 2018","-","Chest pains, headaches galore. Not to mention my memory has been horrible and my legs have been very restless. Thursday (11/22/18) I was relaxing, calm. But then there was a ringing in my ears as there had been everyday 3 days prior. I began to feel like I was dying, which was me beginning to panic due to the effects I've been having. I haven't had health anxiety since I was 8 years old. I'm 18 now, but never this bad. I began to get agitated very quickly and I couldn't stop moving. I was pacing around my house, moving my legs, rocking back and forth and threatening my parents as I grew more agitated and feeling like I was in a cage. I could not get in touch with my prescriber so I had to go to the ER. Eventually, I got tired and it subsided so I did not need the sedative the hospital staff wanted to give me. Blood work, EKG and urine test all fine. I've been on it for roughly 6-8 weeks and it stopped working.",3,8,1
"Rexulti","Cr","November 2, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I wouldn't recommend this drug at all, made me feel extremely anxious and nervous all the time!!",2,7,1
"Rexulti","Dipodo","September 12, 2018","-","Rexulti/Brexpiprazole has been amazing for my lifestyle while dealing with Schizophrenia. When I was on Risperidone, I was having trouble getting up for work, and was getting to work late at 10-10.30am. I also had two episodes of acute Schizophrenia on a low dose Risperidone over 4 years. The side effects on a higher dose of risperidone made me feel lethargic and tired all day. However, on an equivalent dose of Rexulti, the voices are not there anymore. Intrusive thoughts are more controlled. And I get up early enough in the morning to get to work by 8.30-9! Has happened for two weeks now, and I'm pretty sure this will continue, because I don't feel the same lethargy as I did on risperidone. So in effect, I'm on a relatively high dose, but the side effects are much lower than risperidone. I am really happy with the results.",10,14,1
"Rexulti","Coryman616","August 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Rexulti is the first anti-psychotic I've been on with no apparent side effects. It has my schizophrenia under control and has completely gotten rid of my voices. It also helps control my paranoia, psychosis, and helps with my gut-wrenching anxiety so I can get out of my apartment and lead a normal life. I have nothing but good things to say about Rexulti.",10,26,1
"Rexulti","Schizogirl","June 24, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medicine is horrible. My hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia are increased 10 times worse than before. I have agitation, body temperature dysregulation issues, dizziness, insomnia (despite taking Temazepam), and it makes it difficult to think. I don't recommend this medication.",1,6,1
"Rexulti","cobweb","May 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Rexulti has stopped my delusions and obsessive ruminationing where Seroquel XR amongst others failed,  and in the short period of time I have been on this drug, it has also mostly taken away my extreme paranoid anxiety, which was unrelenting.  My brain is quiet and calm. A slight opiate like warmth and peace of mind. It is lifting a depressive episode, in a much smoother, mild way compared to my experience on Effexor XR.  No akathisia. I am not sure if my sleep is affected because I have always had sleep issues regardless. I am prescribed a little Temazepam to sleep if needed. A slight headache for a few days upon starting, no nausea. No weight gain.  Very pleased with how this is working so far.",8,17,1
"Rexulti","james youngfellow","April 8, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I tapered off Haldol and took this medicine. By itself it does no good and sent me to the mental hospital. They gave me Haldol along with Rexulti and since then it has been very good. I don't even hardly think about a hallucination or delusion anymore much less experience them.",9,11,1
"Rexulti","davos777","February 27, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Rexulti seems too be a good medicine so far. After one week my paranoia is almost gone. I do notice a speedy effect which has caused me too be more active. This is actually good because rexulti is helping me too get out of the house and avoid some social phobia issues.  I would definitely recommend this med if you have any kind of paranoia associated with bipolar depression. Tommorow the 7th day I will increase too one mg. Lets hope this med continues too work .Thanks and good luck. Ps I have been on many meds and hated most all atypical antipsychotics.",8,18,1
"Rexulti","Jameelah1","December 7, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I am on a dose of 4 mg. I feel very pleased about this medication. It is very quiet, no voices. I have been on the medication for 2 months. I was gradually introduced to a higher and higher dose. At 4 mg., I  am finally not afraid from the thoughts I have that are delusions. I do have an increase in appetite, and a bit of restlessness. But the benefits of this medicine far outweigh any adverse effects.  I am not anxious as bad as I was either. And I can get up and take care of housework better. I am liking this med very much.",0,15,1
"Rexulti","Mmaryland","June 26, 2017","-","Rexulti has helped my bipolar mania in so many way. From previous experience with antipsychotics, I was expecting side effects like increased appetite, excessive sleepiness, etc.  I did get akathisia when I first began, but I did begin at 3mg (a high dose). I reduced back down to 0.5 and gradually increased to 1mg. So far (1.5 months), I have seen extreme improvement in my mood and sleep schedule. I feel more motivated and am getting more of my responsibilities done. My social anxiety is pretty much gone as is my GAD. The only issues I have is periodically having trouble falling asleep, but this is not significant.  Overall, I think Rexulti has really helped me in many ways and I attribute the positive results in my recent life to Rexulti",0,28,1
"Rexulti","Suzanne L","June 17, 2017","-","for the first week I took this, I had some nausea and very intense sleepiness that made me take one and even 2 naps during the day. But I changed the time of day I took it and that seemed to help. For the first month I was sooo happy, and a lot less delusional. I'm not quite sure where it all went wrong. Now, my delusions have worsened, I've developed an intense phobia of driving and being in a car in general. I have many intrusive thoughts and honestly I'm considering stopping it. Which sucks because it worked there for awhile. I wouldn't say don't take this medicine, but pay attention to your body and be wary of any anxiety you're experiencing and talk to your doctor to get a handle on it before it gets out of hand.",0,16,1
"Rexulti","Dissapointed","March 2, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I am not sure how many months I have been on this medication, but while I have been on it I have managed to gain almost 10 pounds. I do not feel like I over-eat either. The weight just seems to pile on.  I feel incredibly sleepy during the day.  So much so that on most days I take a long nap.  I have very little energy. My stomach seems to bloat out more. Otherwise I seem to be doing just fine, both mentally and physically.  So if you don't mind being fat, lazy, and lifeless; but not crazy; this might just be the drug for you!",6,29,1

"Rexulti","Donna mar","December 29, 2016","-","I was taking this for  ADD .right now I had to stop taking it the doc was giving me samples n I ran out waiting for my insurance co to give the ok . This med has changed my life. My thinking is very scattered like there's a radio on in my head. It's like the  rexulti shut the radio off I can think so clear. My thinking is not jumping around When I am on it.I look forward to things Not bored. Want to try new things.  Organizing comes so easy",10,55,1
"Rexulti","Kutiekatie22","August 10, 2016","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This was a game changing medication for me. I was diagnosed schizoaffective, later changed to bipolar 1. I was a zombie from the medication combination I used to be on, zyprexa and depakote. Changing the zyprexa to rexulti gave me my life back. At first, it gave me side effects of dizziness and anxiety, but after stopping and trying again, its given me energy, concentration, and the mood swings and psychosis stopped. I'm very happy with this medication. I just upped the dosage from 2mg to 3mg after being on it for a year and a half.",9,30,1

"Rexulti","SchizoMan32","April 20, 2016","-","This drug made me feel crazy! Increased hallucinations, delusions and paranoia! Wouldn't recommend to anyone, stay away from this med!!!",1,23,2

"Rexulti","Nicki234","March 31, 2016","-","Horrible experience, I am schizoaffective and I felt as though I was going crazy on this medicine.",1,19,2
"Rexulti","PeaceLoveHappiness","December 17, 2015","-","I was taking risperdal before this but that made me too lethargic and have loss of interest in everything. Rexulti has helped me with my bipolar and mild schizophrenia. I take 2mg/day. I only had minor side effects like headaches and upset stomach the first week which faded away. I also take Celexa 40mg a day which I have been on for a year. The first few months it worked great but these past few months it doesn't seem to be working. I'm considering cutting down to 20mg/day of celexa because I think the combination of these drugs is too strong for me.",8,25,2

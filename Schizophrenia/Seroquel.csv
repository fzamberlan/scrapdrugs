"Seroquel","123","June 4, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I used to take this drug Seroquel for 7 years. The only side effects I had was sleeping too much, no way to wake up in the morning and still sleeping for 1st hour of being awake. Once I threw up breakfast because my body was just not working yet. And I was always putting guilt on me, because I didn't know that this is pill side effect. I used to think I am lazy, because I couldn't wake up. When having job, I always needed someone who woke me up, because I always turned off the alarm unaware, while sleeping. Only now when I changed pills and can normally wake up I see that I am not lazy and I am very happy for that fact! Another side effect was muscles cramps in legs - when I went to bed, I couldn't stay still, I had to move my legs because of some weird muscle tightens. This happened occasionally. The side effects were not so terrible. It didn't do any harm to mind and emotions.",8,5,1
"Seroquel","Cutie Boots","April 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My son has autism and anxiety.  He started experiencing psychosis/auditory hallucinations at age 18...so bad he would yell and get very angry.  We have started Seroquel, on it over 2 months now, some improvement but not great.  His doc has now upped it from 25mg and we are now 500 mg.  Along with Mirtazipine and Ativan for sleep.  Hoping we can stay ahead of of his episodes instead of chasing them.  I’ll give an update.  Super helpful to read others reviews.  praying we see some good results.",7,8,1
"Seroquel","Otto","April 17, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've had a lot of side effects caused by this drug I never knew it was caused by this drug, I had high blood pressure, terrible gas last for days, muscle cramps, seizures I gained 60 lbs or more imbalance drug for 5 years or more I would not recommend it for anybody",1,5,1
"Seroquel","Winterviolet","November 27, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started 100 mg of Seroquel after Abilify failed at managing my symptoms.  On Abilify I was waking with constant anxiety and restless leg syndrome.  Once I started taking Seroquel anxiety and restless leg syndrome disappeared and I’m feeling the best I’ve felt in a long time.  The first week I was tired but after that passed it’s been nothing but a sense of inner peace and calmness.  So happy I tried this medicine again.  I think the dose of 100 mg is a perfect dose for me.",10,34,1
"Seroquel","Katie","November 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I rely on this for my sleep and psychosis episodes. I take 1/2 the 25mg as needed. No weight gain. I exercise and eat healthy. It's a lifesaver knowing my scary episodes can be treated with this.",10,23,1

"Seroquel","Kat","October 19, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I find Seroquel great I was diagnosed with schitzophenia in 2001 and haven't been hospitalized since then. It works great for me",10,20,1
"Seroquel","Mrmeds","August 29, 2019","-","This drug has really helped me with the voices and the paranoia. I have been on it for nearly 3 years. I have been on pretty much every antipsychotic there is and have been dealing with this illness for a long, long time. The downside is that you will gain weight. I have lost some of it by reducing calories and taking metformin. Walking seems to help too. If you do take this one, stay as active as you can to avoid diabetes because as my psychiatrist told me It will happen eventually Also, I adopted a vegatarian diet to help lower other risks with this one. The other downside is that it can make you very tired. I take 400mg at night and 75mg in the morning and another 75mg in the afternoon. I still hear voices and don't want to be around other people but it is much more manageable and I can at least have some kind of life. To be honest, I probably would have killed myself if it were not for this drug. I am surprised I even wrote this as I am a very paranoid person.",10,51,1

"Seroquel","Coryman616","August 25, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I was on Seroquel for years for my schizophrenia. It did work really good, kept my psychosis down, kept me in reality. Really helped get rid of the voices although I did still hear some. Unfortunately I had to be taken off of Seroquel due to the damage it was causing to my liver. If it wasn't for the negative side effects it would have been the perfect medication for me.",8,23,1
"Seroquel","saphire","April 26, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I took one pill 50 mg I was in such a deep sleep my children could not wake me up even the next morning I felt like I was drugged I slept the entire day away.  You can forget about driving on this stuff two days later I still felt the affects of the drug.",1,14,1
"Seroquel","Suraya Jada","February 13, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been taking Seroquel for a long time. It destroyed my life. It's addictive because when you stop taking it you'll never be able to sleep again. There's no getting off of it. I sleep in till 2 to 5 pm every day. I'm sluggish all day. It never helped with any of my symptoms of schizophrenia. It makes me crave sugar immensely. This drug is very dangerous. You have to be very careful when taking it. Don't drive or be around people you don't know or trust. Let's just say I could sleep through anything. This drug should be illegal even if it does help some people with their mental illness. There are other things people can take. Risperdal for example does wonders for me. I'm working with my doctor on getting off of Seroquel. I didn't do it sooner because I'm so sick I can barely accomplish anything really. I just want to say to all schizophrenics I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that NOBODY has any idea of what's happening to you.",1,38,1
"Seroquel","Boo’s Mom","February 2, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","My daughter began taking 400mg of Seroquel when she was 17 years old. The first year she gained over 40 pounds.  Her doctor recognized that the weight gain was contributing to her depression. He prescribed Topamax. My understanding is that  Topamax is normally used to treat seizures but this medication also helps with impulsivity (which she struggles with as well).   A side effect is that it’s an appetite suppressant, or at least that’s how it effects my daughter.  She currently takes  100 mg a day and is back down to her regular weight.  I hope others can safely be prescribe this medication  if their doctors find it appropriate.",8,19,1
"Seroquel","ac674","November 7, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","helps with delusions and hallucinations with schizophrenia, it doesn't help anxiety but does aid sleep at start but now I can take 400-800 at night and it still won't make me tired just calms my schizophrenia down a lot. It is a very good antipsychotic not sure how people use it for sleep and it did help with sleep for the first week and now it  doesn't make me sedated or tired but sedates my mind.",9,10,1
"Seroquel","Anonymous","September 3, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Wow this medication.. it may have knocked me out many times (put me to sleep).. Hell it may have had made me sleepy 24/7, I would sleep sometimes 18 hours a day I spent a lot of time recovering with this medication.. sleeping. But I can't complain because well.. I have my life back. And I thank all those people who put their time and effort in producing this medication because without them, who knows where I'd be.. right now I'm back in college off of this medication but still on abilify. This drug may not be the cure to schizophrenia.. but it does wonders.",10,14,1
"Seroquel","Paranoid Schizophrenic","June 18, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Out of all the anti-psychotics I have taken, Seroquel makes me feel the most normal! I was on put on Geodon originally in 2012 when I had my first psychotic break.  The Geodon made me gain 60 lb eventually caused insomnia, binge eating, and heavy drinking. Drugs like Fanapt and Lutuda made me more depressed/mind rush.  I was put on Seroquel in 2015. My binge eating disorder continued, and I gained 40 lbs that year :/. It made me feel a million times better than Geodon though. I was able to stop popping Xanax and klonopin everyday. I eventually stopped binge eating in October, 2016 and lost the 40lbs. Currently I take 600mg of seroquel and 100mg of Zoloft, and .5 mg of Xanax at night as needed to quiet my thoughts.",10,22,1
"Seroquel","Lana girl","May 28, 2017","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I take 300mg. It's been 5 years. I was on higher doses, once up to 900 mg. My delusions never went away, but I can control my thoughts better. I think of something delusional, but I don't follow the train of thought. Since I started a serious relationship 2 years ago, I have been working on my anger and paranoia that he would hurt me. It's harder to control my emotions. Right now, I have a outrageous story in my head about him, but after reading the posts on this website, I know these feelings aren't new. I've felt them with my own family. I'm going to a National Alliance of Mental health Illness (NAMI) meeting soon to get support about how lonely it can feel to be exhausted. I pray in the morning to help my negative feelings and meditate at night to be present.",9,23,1
"Seroquel","Samantha554444","May 25, 2017","-","This medication was given to me free at my first visit to my psychiatrist. He assured me that he hasn't heard of any adverse side effects. Well this stuff put my entire body into extreme shock. I did not drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, don't smoke, and took proper dosage as prescribed. I was rushed to the hospital on this stuff, first dose. It was like my entire body on the inside was constantly being shocked with electricity and outside I literally could not move or even sit up. My body was shaking and felt freezing and had the feeling of being bruised. Took about 6 to 8 hours to wear off. Did not take again.",1,22,1
"Seroquel","voskhod","April 12, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Definitely calmed me down during the first-time onset of schizophrenia. However it makes me very sleepy, sometimes I sleep 14 hours a day - and when I wake up I feel like I want to sleep even more. Also resulted in a lot of weight gain. Eventually had to stop taking it because of how tired I always was.",6,16,1
"Seroquel","RG33","March 22, 2017","-","The drug made me gain weight and become depressed which I was never before using of the drug. I now have an addiction that I can't beat. I would probably sue them for not warning me about the drugs addictive properties. I think  this drug may help some people. However people have a right to be informed about what they are getting into.",1,24,1
"Seroquel","Meghan1987bezanso","September 4, 2016","-","I was prescribed Seroquel for PTSD. Never again. 25 mg, I had the worst panic attack if my life, I could barely walk, but I was so scared I kept trying to run around. It was horrible. I went absolutely crazy then passed out hard. Not my kind of medication. My mother inlaw takes 250 mg a day for schizophrenia, she has for six months now,  so far it is not helping her delusions, hallucinations, paranoia. She was told to take it at supper time and seemed drunk and sedated all evening. She now takes it at bed time but it is not helping her. :(",1,29,1
"Seroquel","SmokeyO123456789","July 11, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I've been prescribed seraquel now for roughly a year and the side effects are soooooo nasty I wouldn't recommend it at all,the main thing that attacks me relentlessly is the tickles under the skin in the legs and I'm probably keeping the neighbors awake cos Iv gotta keep stretching my legs and wriggling in bed to calm down the relentless torment that comes back maybe every 5/10 seconds for roughly 5/8hrs most nights,I've also got to the point where it feels like I'm going to swallow my tongue for hours on end and I wander if I'm gonna be alive the next day as well,I get to the point where I'm nearly asleep and self resuscitate with a jolt of adrenaline in my heart and a deep breath like I nearly drowned and nearly have a heart attack,it's NASTY",1,20,1
"Seroquel","Lizziepoo","April 8, 2016","-","I complained to a friend of insomnia, mainly stress related. She offered a seroquel on the promise that it would relax me and put me in la la land. I will never again take medicine that is not prescribed for me! For the first time ever... I heard voices starting at 2 am. I heard two men arguing on the other side of my closed bedroom door, loud enough to wake me but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I was too afraid to look because I knew no one was there. Then around 4:30 am I heard a baby crying non stop this lasted until 7:00 am. I sat up for hours listening to what if feels like to be going insane! Never again!",1,25,1
"Seroquel","Bazzzaaa1","January 4, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been taking seroquel for 17 years . I am diagnosed as schizophrenic but for the last 10 years I have had very little symptoms. After 6 years of being shifted from one med to another all of which made me feel awful, made me put on weight and had no effect on my condition.I was happy to be put on seroquel purely because I felt normal but still had very little effect on my symptoms. I was very reluctant to change meds again so stuck with it . I had my energy back and was getting out exercising and started to loose the weight I'd put on . The schizophrenia was still there but at least I was getting a break from just sitting there with it.  It took a while but after 2-3 years the symptoms started to decrease and just kept on decreasing .",9,44,1
"Seroquel","English friend","January 2, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been taking this drug for a few months I'm on a very high dose (800mg). I was finding on lower doses my paranoia was overwhelming and my depression was getting to the suicidal point. Now I'm on a higher dose I'm like a zombie, lack of motivation in everything I do. For me personally, I do not think its the right drug for me but everyone takes to medications differently",1,13,1
"Seroquel","ZeldaKitten","June 22, 2015","-","I've been on seroquel twice now. I was hearing voices all day that affected my PTSD, then it was a falling block thing with my anxiety and depression.  I love this medication because I also have sleeping problems - falling asleep and staying asleep.  There's XR and non XR (time release). I'm on 450; the higher you are on, the longer it takes to fall asleep.  The only bad thing about this medication is weight gain. Be careful with that. I did research on all schizophrenic medications and they all cause weight gain.  Just a note; the reason I pay $60 is because I need to take 300 + 150 to make 450. The XR is $15 more. I go under blue cross blue shield, if this helps anyone.",10,27,2
"Seroquel","zaiyd&amp;lola","December 6, 2014","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I'm been on Seroquel since been diagnosed (now 18 months). Started taking 50g but now I'm on 100g. I've got to the point on this medication that the side effects are too much. Constantly tired. Feel very vague. My memory is terrible. I'm starting to forget about things I've already done. Still very paranoid. Also I'm still having panic attacks. So for me, it's time to move on and try something new (Olanzapine).",6,34,2
"Seroquel","Corksters","December 1, 2014","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Seroquel- Out of Risperdal, Zyprexa, Trilafon, Abilify, Haldol, and Geodon, Seroquel is by far the best one. At lower doses, it is good for anxiety. You don't feel like a zombie on it. Obviously it helps you sleep, but at lower doses you won't be sleepy or if you just take it at bed time. Abilify and Haldol turned me into a complete zombie it was terrible. Risperdal had sexual side effects and of course the breast growth issue, but I would say Risperdal is the second best one behind Seroquel. Haldol and Abilify help paranoia big time but they also exasperate anxiety, definitely stay away from those. Geodon and Zyprexa are worse than those medicines. Geodon made me disoriented, helpless, still very paranoid. Zyprexa is probably the second worst.",8,43,2
"Seroquel","country mom","February 21, 2013","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed this for paranoid Psychosis and depression. At first I was to take a half of a 100mg tablet at night for a week then raise to the whole pill.  After taking the half the first night at eight and feeling drunk I decided this might not be for me so I cut the half in half and take a quarter pill a night.  It has helped me sleep and seems to curve my over thinking things and thinking that every comment or conversation on social media is about me.  I think also by getting off social media altogether it also helped my situation.  But overall good medication, it's the only thing I take.",7,46,2
"Seroquel","Anonymous","December 21, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Seroquel worked in getting rid of my psychotic symptoms (voices, etc). It was a hard medication to go on, I would need to sleep 12 hours during the first week and I would wake up in that 12 hours in an almost intoxicated state. There was nothing that would wake me up in the morning but I think during medication changes it is important to listen to your body so I rested and in a week, that went away. I came off Risperidone in that first week as well so that may have contributed. The medication did make me sweat a LOT and it would take me a long time to cool down on it. My dyskensic side effects from risperidone went away. But I had to come off Seroquel in a month because I had an allergic 3 weeks in...watch out for tight throat/trouble swallowing.",9,39,2
"Seroquel","Correlation","December 11, 2012","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I take a dose of 600mg at night time (because it makes me sleep). I wish that I could take less because I don't like that it makes me so tired but I need it to stay sane. I've been on it for 5 years and I used to sleep about 12 hours but now it's down to 9. The good thing about Seroquel is that I have only sleeping as a side effect. I have been on other meds and had everything, dry mouth, blurred vision, drooling, constipation, you name it, I had it. So Seroquel is at least good for that. The only bad thing in the last 2 years I have noticed over-thinking and like a conversation going on in my head but I cant find a good medicine and I don't want to increase Seroquel because of the sleepiness",8,41,2
"Seroquel","Anonymous","May 18, 2012","Taken for 1 to 2 years","No anti-psychotic medicine is perfect. But Seroquel is quite okay. Gives you a good night of sleep. You can feel dizzy. But the best is no extra pyramidal symptoms.  I tried 4 or 5 other antipsychotics but this as good as it gets considering side effects.",8,28,2
"Seroquel","Anonymous","September 24, 2010","-","Seroquel was a God send for me.  I've been on it for 7 years and its the best medication I've been on for hallucinations and the voices I heard on a daily basis.  It does however make me extremely tired so I take it half hour before I go to bed.  I did get a little weight gain but I would rather have weight gain than hearing voices and seeing things any day.  Amazing medication.",10,63,2
"Seroquel","Anonymous","February 19, 2009","-","Pretty good medication for the condition. My thoughts are more straight and I seem to have less visual and auditory distortions. It is sedating though and takes a little time for your body to adjust to it. I take 100mg in the morning and 400mg at night, seems to work pretty good in combination with Effexor for depression, and it's decent for mild anxiety (however if you have major anxiety, it may not be enough on its own).",8,48,2

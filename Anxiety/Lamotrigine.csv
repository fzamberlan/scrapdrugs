"Lamotrigine","Kate","June 4, 2020","-","I never review meds but I feel like I’m doing a disservice but not sharing. SO PLEASE READ! I was prescribed lamotrigine at my lowest point. I was struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression and PMMD. I was facing constant intrusive thoughts about death and sadness. I came home from the doctors after being prescribed and read these reviews and bawled my eyes out. I was so afraid of taking this medication. Yet, I needed something to help ASAP.  I have now been taking lamotrigine for 3 months and my anxiety is much lower, my emotions are not out of control before my period and I have more peace of mind.  I don’t have any bad side affects. My biggest recommendation is to start with a low dose (50mg) and after two weeks (100mg). I feel like taking more than this ups your chance of having a bad reaction. We are all different so there is no guarantee. Just know that this website is usual used if you have had a relatively bad experience so take that into consideration.",10,6,1
"Lamotrigine","Anonymous","May 11, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","My anxiety is severe where I experience nerve pain. I was prescribed to the medication lamotrigine from my psychiatrist 2 months ago but, I was scared to take it. I recently got over the fear of taking this medication and started it 8 days ago - I feel no difference, just feel more anxious and jittery. No problems in sleep but, I would wake up feeling super jittery from chest to legs. Will continue to take it and see how it goes in the next few weeks",4,4,1
"Lamotrigine","Meli","May 4, 2020","-","I had tried lamictal about a year ago for anxiety and depression, and worked my way up to 100mg dosage. Mostly I noticed that I would get very emotional while on this medication, to the point that it was completely overwhelming and uncontrollable.     My first two days on the medication, I felt good. But I started having very violent and vivid nightmares and insomnia. I would have a panic attacks daily. I experienced some uncontrollable tremors and shaking over my whole body for hours. I felt very sick, and nauseous. Recently I’ve noticed I had strong impulsive thoughts, which triggered panic attacks and just left me unable to function.    At this point I feel like I’m not able to function in my daily life. I have had to take clonazepam multiple times daily since I’ve been on this medication when I had gone over two months without taking any.",1,6,1

"Lamotrigine","Trinak","February 8, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Lexapro worked for years then stopped. Tried multiple other meds without success. Dr though we’d try lam as a mood stabilizer. First 2 days I felt a weird   disconnected  feeling but that left. I had internal tremor in the mornings which lasted till noon followed by a mild mania/ restlessness in afternoon. I was definitely cognitively sharper. By evening I would feel a bit of a crash/ low.  But then it started to cause nightmares for me, waking multiple times at night in panic and sweating (I have prior trauma). So too sum things up, tremor, mania and nightmares were not doing my anxiety and depression any good. I slowly reduced and stopped this med as it wasn’t right for me.",2,6,1

"Lamotrigine","caro","February 3, 2020","-","Lamictal completely changed my life. Before I started it, I'd have bursts of anger due to pent up anxiety over the nit-pickiest things. I thought I was just a jerk and didn't understand why. Quickly after I started taking Lamictal (250mg for anxiety) I noticed a huge difference. I felt relaxed for once. Not euphoric, or like a different person, just... Normal! Calm, collected, but still sharp. Lamictal was like a valve that drained my anger out when I was just about full of rage. I personally haven't noticed many side effects, at least none that I don't already have from SSRIs. Loss of coordination is a big one and I only get tremors if I haven't eaten but that might just be low blood sugar. In conclusion, being someone who suffers from chronic general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, I can definitely see Lamictal being an effective long term medication. Works great for me.",10,25,1

"Lamotrigine","goodhands","November 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Have been suffering from anxiety, panic and bipolar depression for 20+ years. Have been on every cocktail imaginable and was my best on Klonopin, Remeron and Zyprexa. Zyprexa caused me to gain 60 lbs over 4 years and made my blood sugar crazy. Trying to come off was really awful, I dropped from 10mg to 5mg to 2.5 to 1.25 for months. After several failed attempts trying to cross with Latuda, Abilify and Seroquel, my doctor prescribed Lamictal and it's changed my life completely. My depression is all but gone, my moods are better, anxiety is lower and I've been Zyprexa free for 2 months and lost 19 lbs. I am currently at 50 mg and our goal dosage is 100mg. Took a few days to kick in and getting better by the day. Finally getting my life back!!!!!",10,29,1
"Lamotrigine","jb","October 30, 2019","-","I've been on this for years. I am a stroke survivor and thought my very bad hand tremors were due to stroke. No, they were made much worse by lamotrigine. I thought so though one doctor said not. I have cut down very gradually to 25mgs from 200mg (taken about a year) and the withdrawal has been horrible once at about 50 to 75- exhaustion, anxiety and bad gut aches and obsessive thoughts. Almost as bad as SSRI withdrawal. So I am eventually stopping altogether. I have now tried virtually every mood disorder/anxiety/depression med so will just have to use much more cognitive techniques. I also take inderal and clonazepam (.5 once a day). I know I am addicted to clonazepam but I feel I have little choice given that my anxiety was very severe leading to inability to work at all. I'm sure that lamotrigine helps many people . I caution people if you  discontinued,  then go slow. Hopefully now I will be able to eat with one hand as the shaking will lessen.",1,9,1
"Lamotrigine","Sb123","October 25, 2019","-","I have struggled with anxiety off and on over the years. I tried SSRI’s in the past and those never gave me much of any relief. I got to a point where I was in a downward spiral of anxiety (crazy thoughts, wild mood swings, uneasy digestive issues, sleep issues, etc). I decided to give medicine another shot. My doc prescribed me lamictal and now on 100mg. I am MUCH more stable. I don’t have the crazy intrusive thoughts as much and my perspective on life is much more positive. It did not make me dull or any other negative side effect. It just gradually allowed me to be myself again and enjoy life. Please do know that medication in general can absolutely help. Do not listen to outsiders who do not understand how you feel. Medication is a personal option that you should feel no judgment about. If it helps you then that’s all that matters! It may take awhile to find the right medication for you but it is worth it. Never give up. There is something that will help you.",10,60,1

It was wonderful &amp; unexpected. That night, shortly after going to bed, I began to sweat like crazy! I figured it had to be a strange coincidence, but the next day, the sweating continued. My doctor said sweating was not a side effect, when I explained my symptom. She said to keep taking the Lamictal, and so I did.  Long story short, I had to discontinue this medication. It was wonderful for anxiety, but the sweating was just too much, and I couldn't get a good night's sleep.",4,11,1

"Lamotrigine","joe","March 29, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This made life so much better. I think my doctors prescribed every SSRI and SNRI there is. Each one made me sicker than the last one. A couple of them made me miss weeks of work at a time. I started on such a low dose that it made no difference, I was just happy it didn't make me sick, so I kept taking it. Finally I went up to a full 25mg and I will never forget the first time I felt this stuff kick a panic attack's ass! I literally felt it stuff it down and smother it! 6 months later I'm up to 50mg and on the rare occasion I feel an attack coming on it is never as severe as it used to be. After doing some reading on this med, it is the last resort for anxiety. If You get sick on anti depressants, stop messing around and demand your doctor prescribe this. I was worried that this was a seizure med and was skeptical, it has exceeded expectations. I doubt there is anything that cures anxiety, but lamotrigine sure works for Me.",10,73,1

I can now go in public places without having a breakdown and my family has noticed a huge difference. I’m taking better care of myself and have the energy and desire to walk again. The only downfall is you have to titrate up slowly so you can get discouraged at first thinking it isn’t working. I’m now on 200mg and it’s been a game changer. Don’t give up on this medicine as it is a miracle worker.

"Lamotrigine","Anonymous","November 5, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","The only thing I've tried that's helped my anxiety and not had debilitating side effects. You have to slowly ramp up the dose to avoid the potential rash. 25mg, then 50mg, then 100mg, etc. It's also a bit stimulating for a few days whenever you increase the dose and this can manifest in anxiety if you're not moving around. But I can say that this drug is great - it helps all of my co-morbid symptoms to some degree - anxiety, bipolar, mood, etc. I'm now on 300mg extended release and feeling a lot better than I did before I started this. It brought my anxiety from an 8 down to a 5, I'd say, which still isn't great but I'm actually functional now. Been taking about four months.",10,41,2

I felt like I was getting too anxious and dropped back to 25mg 2xd. After my anxiety was under control, I began to titrate back up and things went really well. I actually think I was getting more anxious before because I was so used to feeling anxious, and not feeling anxious was so foreign to me.

Busperidone gave me that common weird feeling. And while I don't have bipolar, I got hypomanic symptoms and seriously worsened depression/ anxiety with SSRI's (this is widely unknown but common occurrence). After confirming I have a gene that causes the latter, I spoke with my amazing prescriber about giving this a go. Since then, my world has changed for the better. I'm at a higher dose so I often feel a little lethargic but I'll take that side-effect over SSRI's many terrible ones any day. Lamotrigine completely changed my world- highly recommended. I really do suggest taking a genetics test as well. You very well could come up with the same result.",9,36,2

My doctor tried several antidepressants (Zoloft, Celexa, Lexapro, Paxil, Vybrid), and I had no benefits; only side effects. We also tried all kinds of benzodiazepines and they did nothing for me. Ambien would grant me only 3 hours of sleep. My symptoms would go from clammy hands and feet, heart racing and high blood pressure to sheer terror. My first day (really) on Lamotrigine and I already felt the symptoms subside. On the following days I felt even better. In two weeks I was feeling like myself again, so much that I was able to jump on a plane and travel to Brazil by myself. If nothing is working for you, give Lamotrigine a try. I am grateful I did.",10,77,2
"Lamotrigine","Jessiee","December 14, 2015","-","I started taking Lamictal after going to a PHP program. This medication worked really well for me but I was only on it for 2 months because I developed a rash and acne. It made my obsessive and thoughts occur less. I was able to handle situations with more logic and less emotional outbursts. I mean it truly was a great medication. However, my skin has always been clear but it was making me breakout more than I ever have in my life. I also felt like my hair was growing out thinner. If my emotions were totally out of control and life threatening than yes, I would have stayed on it despit the skin and hair problems. However for me it wasn't worth it. I would recommend at least trying it out.",7,22,3
"Lamotrigine","Anonymous","November 22, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","Hey, So I have taken this medication now for about 3 weeks to help me sleep!, the odd thing is, is I have woken up at odd times of the night not being able to fall back asleep!, which triggers my depression later on in the day if I do not get enough sleep, I found out I had Anxiey and Depression while I was on my mission for the church of jesus Christ of latter day saints, I have felt better since being on medication, but I am still waking up at odd times in the night!",4,15,3
"Lamotrigine","brett84","November 17, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","75mg is the dose i've been steady on.  Worked up at 25mg every 2 weeks, with a day or 2 of itchiness on each increase.  I tried 100mg for a few days and felt more anxious and depressed.  Went back down to 75mg and feel pretty good.  Considering insomnia has been a very serious issue for me, Lamictal is the first med i've been on that isn't an AD and doesn't hurt my sleep (I take it in the AM).  When I was trying ADs, the Klonopin barely seemed to work for sleep, I still take Klonopin for sleep but at least I can sleep through the night now.  Nice being off the ADs.  Hope this one works long-term and I can get off the Klonopin eventually which I think is causing my moderate brain fog.  Eh, life is much better than it was.  I recommend it!",9,35,3
"Lamotrigine","lou3","July 31, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I had high hopes for this medication. At 25 mg, I thought I noticed a slight positive effect. About when I upped from 25 to 50 mg, I experienced about two weeks of feeling extremely depressed, which continued when I increased to 75 mg. It did somewhat decrease my agitated anxiety, but did not help with my obsessive ruminations. Aside from the depressed mood and mild sedation, I didn't notice any side effects. When I decreased back to 25 mg, I noticed the depressed mood lifting and an increase in anxiety.",4,27,3
"Lamotrigine","Root Beer Girl","June 19, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","No side effects. I've been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, it had help so much. I am so thankful for this medicine it saved my life, I would suffer for days with no sleep. anxiety is a killer I am glad this med is on the market. I would have committed suicide because of the anxiety, I give many thanks to my doctor for finding something that helped, I can live my life finally.",10,67,3
"Lamotrigine","Mikasa","May 12, 2015","-","I'm taking this medication for anxiety and mood swings. It really does close to nothing with my anxiety. It helps my moods a bit but my anxiety is more bothersome. Not only that, my memory is complete crap. I have trouble finding words, memorizing new information and spelling. I am a great speller and ever since I started taking Lamictal, I've forgotten to spell some words which i would have no problem with before. Overall, I feel this med is doing more bad than good. I started taking Seroquel and I can already feel more positive changes than Lamictal has done since I started taking it.",2,30,3
"Lamotrigine","vistard","April 15, 2015","-","I have been on a small dose of this for about a month.  It has done wonders for me!  I have struggled with anxiety my entire life and have been on several different meds over the years.  This has really helped to calm me down.  I have even lost about 7 lbs over the past month because it is curbing my desire for food.  Everyone notices the difference.",10,61,3

"Lamotrigine","WolfGirl22","August 28, 2014","-","I've been taking this as a mood stabilizer, which has been working, but in all honesty I think they put me on this for mood because of the way the other medicines were making me (Risperidone made me psychotic, so did Zoloft). I'm off those now and am currently on Lamotrigine. But it does nothing for anxiety, not one thing. It's made me worry MORE.",2,29,3

"Escitalopram","That Shadow","June 9, 2020","-","I was prescribed this medicine for anxiety. I always worry about something and recently got troubles sleeping. I took 1 pill escitalopram 10 mg today and started to feel awful. I lost the ability to enjoy anything, I don't want to do anything, cannot get comfortable and all this makes me anxious. Now I realize that I didn't have depression before. I felt much better. No need to say that I cannot sleep in this state. I certainly won't be able to tolerate this for weeks. I'm not taking it.",1,1,1
"Escitalopram","Em","June 6, 2020","-","I started this medication escitalopram on 10mg. It actually worked ok at first. After a couple months it didn’t seem to work for me anymore so I asked my doctor to increase my dosage. He took me to 15mg for a bit then 20mg. I stayed on 20 mg for a few weeks and started having endless energy and insomnia. I began having terrible restless leg syndrome and mania. I decided to taper myself off without talking to my doctor. I went down to 10mg then 5mg. I went back to my dr to tell him everything and he told me to stay on 5mg. After a few more weeks I went off it. I started having other symptoms being off it so my family told me to go back on it. A few days later I had immense energy, where I felt on top of the world and not in a good way. I believe I was experiencing extreme mania. After days of this I had a horrible anxiety attack. I stopped the medication immediately and called my doctor. All the back and forth may have led me to the severe anxiety attack/ nervous breakdown.",1,8,1

HORRIBLE panic attacks, despersonalization, couldn't breathe, couldn't walk and thinking I'm going to die. Started to take Lexapro. No side effects and it helped me a lot. Took it for 1 year and I started to change my lifestyle to have little to none stress. 2. 19 y.o. Stress came back and so did the anxiety. No panic attacks tho. Begun to take the med, started to enjoy things again. Had side effects this time. Gained 30 pounds over 8 months! Had EXTREME loss of libido. After one year and a half, I really can't say it did more good than bad this last time. I've been off it for 2 months now. I have insomnia and struggle to lose weight. I'm eating healthy on a C.D, exercising 6/w and yet I hardly lose any weight. I still have really dark thoughts when I go to sleep and overthinking are still there.  So I have mixed thoughts about this medication. First time it helped, years later it came back and it did little to nothing.",0,7,1

So far my top 4 symptoms of insomnia, dissociation, emotional flatness and irritability/edginess have improved to the point where I don't notice them anymore.  I'm more relaxed and more myself.

Now I totally understand their point of view. I was  okay  for a week, I felt happier, but high. I’m not sure if my serotonin is just THAT low, but I doubt it. I seriously don’t recommend this to anyone who is severely anxious, as you may feel okay at first, then it throws you completely off.

Drs couldn't find anything wrong and my anxiety was intense from these which led them to believe it must be panic attacks. First week low dose felt really messed up but I was encouraged to keep it up.  Then one day I suddenly dropped into paralysis and felt a fear I that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. I've been bad before many times and never felt this kind of fear. It felt like my organs were shutting down. I couldn't scream. I couldn't breathe. I was deaf and blind, while sweat poured off me. Everything was paralyzed.     It lasted a few minutes and I hyperventilated when it finally stopped as I had been unable to breathe that whole time.  The Dr told me it was a panic attack and to keep taking them. I said I couldn't and he said it's just a placebo anyways. He didn't believe my reaction and became angry with me. Because of this I now have a huge fear of SSRIs and distrust in the medical system.",0,43,1

I also used to overthink and cry ALOT - i think now there’s maybe an 80% decrease of crying in my life. No huge major panic attacks since about the second month of the drug - was initially put on it as I had to go to the ER for breathing issues due to panic attacks. Seriously if you are contemplating an SSRI for your anxiety don’t hesitate to suggest this one to your doctor - I’m so glad it was suggested to me. Down side: I would say that I have gained weight from the med, maybe around 10-15 lbs however I don’t think this is necessarily a bad thing as I don’t think I had the most healthy appetite when my anxiety was at its peak (constant stomach aches).",8,33,1

I was also prescribed Remeron at one point for sleeping problems. That didn’t work so I started on Seroquel xr. this medication along with seroquel has been such a positive change in feeling for me.

Xanax was the only magic pill that calmed my anxious stomach mind connection but its not ideal long term so I tried Escitalopram. The beginning is not pleasant and the drug caused more stomach upset initially. 4 months later on 20mg I feel a lot better. My anxiety has reduced a lot and my stomach is better. It is giving me space to heal that troublesome mind gut connection. Also side note anxiety usually causes you to produce less stomach acid and not more stomach acid. The symptoms are the same but the treatment is different. Doctor readily hand out acid suppressing drugs but usually what you need is more stomach acid.

Not as good as he wanted so he went to 10mg and had a relapse of side effects but to me the panic attack seemed slightly less severe and passed quickly. It has been a month on the 20mg and he has had several bad panic attacks and some increased anxiety. We were really worried about this but then did some more reading and it seems that it was common for people to have this happen after a month but it passed. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this happen after a month of starting and if they continued. Did it get better and how long until it passed.",0,33,2

Still, it took me at least a week to feel ‘normal’ again &amp; that’s after only a single dose!  The half-life in this medication is extremely long.

It took a couple weeks (at 5 mg daily) to kick in, then works great (for anxiety, at least) as long as I don’t drink, stay up late, or cut my benzo dose.

I’m writing this mainly to report an interesting side effect: my libido is better, so are my erections and have sexy dreams.

As of now, my level of anxiety has significantly decreased. I feel much more confident socializing and can finally concentrate. The ONLY problem is feeling very tired and lethargic, which I think is a much better alternative to feeling anxious all the time because you are at ease.

It won't fix you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts.  1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented. 2. ignore the negative reviews that are like I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*. They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely.  3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",0,104,14

I lost my car, my home, my job - everything because I didn't care! I was always sleepy and could sleep 14 hours straight. I had major sexual dysfunction at 26 years. I tapered off slowly after about 8 weeks. I was left with constant dizziness weeks after to the point that I fell down the stairs.  Over a month after stopping, I'm doing well. No meds. Just making positive changes and counselling and trying to get back everything I lost in a couple of months on this med. I still have a little anxiety but I'm learning to control it.

Achieving an orgasm was harder than before, but not impossible (I'm female). Dreams were more vivid, but not bad. Current side effects: Continued vivid dreams.

The first three weeks definitely took getting used to as I felt quite bad at times. After that, the meds started to help week after week I could see myself progressing.

Another thing that I have noticed is that it increased my anxiety for the first 5 days, which I account as a possible side effect. BUT, what I am sure about is that it started changing my life from day 6 already!! I feel happy most of the time and my anxiety diminished to a level that is actually close to normal. Of course, I cannot be sure that me feeling so much better is all thanks to the drug, since it is too soon to say, but I am so looking forward to experience its full effect!",10,10,19

My anxiety is much better and I can do more things. I went back to work and can attend social events again.  The negatives for me was how long it took for the meds to take effect (it was about 1-2 months of increased anxiety, loss of appetite, loss of sex drive, irritability) then it started to work and I increased my dosage to 15MG which is what I have been on since. I'd say it took about 4-6 months for full effects and now I still feel anxiety but can handle it better.  Other down side: if I forget my meds for a day or two I definitely feel the effects.

"Escitalopram","Anonymous","November 24, 2008","-","<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I was slowly suffering from anxiety (through high school) and never really knew it. About 3 years ago (age 29) I began to have anxiety and panic attacks after a vet visit with my cat. I seizured from the anxiety of being in the vet office and from then on for about a year the anxiety turned into panic attacks at work, meetings, car, home. It wasn't until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro. It has completely changed my anxiety. I still have occasionall anxiety but no attacks. Main side effect was low sex drive.",0,86,46

That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant.",0,15,46

A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go wow, I've over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I'm hungry.

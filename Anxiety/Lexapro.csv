"Lexapro","Nks","June 4, 2020","-","I took Lexapro 2 times over my 21 years of life.  1. 13 y.o. HORRIBLE panic attacks, despersonalization, couldn't breathe, couldn't walk and thinking I'm going to die. Started to take Lexapro. No side effects and it helped me a lot. Took it for 1 year and I started to change my lifestyle to have little to none stress. 2. 19 y.o. Stress came back and so did the anxiety. No panic attacks tho. Begun to take the med, started to enjoy things again. Had side effects this time. Gained 30 pounds over 8 months! Had EXTREME loss of libido. After one year and a half, I really can't say it did more good than bad this last time. I've been off it for 2 months now. I have insomnia and struggle to lose weight. I'm eating healthy on a C.D, exercising 6/w and yet I hardly lose any weight. I still have really dark thoughts when I go to sleep and overthinking are still there.  So I have mixed thoughts about this medication. First time it helped, years later it came back and it did little to nothing.",7,7,1
"Lexapro","Wallaby","June 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Lexapro changed my life for the better.  My severe depression and anxiety are under control and don't bother me now. The first week was hard but the benefits have been absolutely incredible for me.",10,17,1
"Lexapro","Indie","May 31, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was unsure whether or not this medication Lexapro was working because I was still having bad days and anxiety daily however I let myself run out somehow and ended up being off them for a week, oh boy did I notice it. I was having outbursts that I hadn’t had to that severity in months. I think my dosage potentially needs tweaking but I am doing so much better on this than I was on mirtazapine or fluoxetine. My side effects were minimal - nausea on and off and some insomnia",8,6,1
"Lexapro","Doodlebug","May 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","So I’ve been on this Lexapro for almost a couple months and I’ve been trying to stick it out and see where it gets me I started taking whole pills which was and is terrible the side effects suck so I started taking a half in the morning and a half at evening time I felt like I was finally getting somewhere and my moods were getting better but I keep having what seems like more attacks and for a few days now I’ve just been not myself, dizzy, brain fog, frequent urination, fatigue &amp; it’s so hard to get out of bed in the mornings even when I get plenty of sleep And my sex drive has drastically went down to almost nothing and it’s horrible to where I would rather just deal with attacks and take a Xanax everyday rather than deal with the side effects of this medication. Will be calling my doctor and weaning off it. I want my life back. For all of you that it has worked for I’m happy it worked for you unfortunately everyone’s bodies don’t take things as well as others.",2,13,1
"Lexapro","KRAZYTRUKER","April 30, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","About 3 weeks in. I was on Sertraline for months prior. I maxed out on it. I was given a second med to go with the Lexapro the other day. I have anxiety and PTSD issues it seems. I still have issues but am working through them. The meds do help but my night sweats are still prevalent nightly.",8,11,1
"Lexapro","Heck","February 29, 2020","-","I had issues with random fainting and severe vertigo. Drs couldn't find anything wrong and my anxiety was intense from these which led them to believe it must be panic attacks. First week low dose felt really messed up but I was encouraged to keep it up.  Then one day I suddenly dropped into paralysis and felt a fear I that I didn't know I was capable of feeling. I've been bad before many times and never felt this kind of fear. It felt like my organs were shutting down. I couldn't scream. I couldn't breathe. I was deaf and blind, while sweat poured off me. Everything was paralyzed.     It lasted a few minutes and I hyperventilated when it finally stopped as I had been unable to breathe that whole time.  The Dr told me it was a panic attack and to keep taking them. I said I couldn't and he said it's just a placebo anyways. He didn't believe my reaction and became angry with me. Because of this I now have a huge fear of SSRIs and distrust in the medical system.",1,43,1
"Lexapro","Freedom","February 23, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Lexapro saved my life. Prior to starting the medication, my anxiety was severe. I couldn't leave the house and get into a car without a full blown panic attack-- sobbing, nausea, the works. Therapy wasn't cutting it, and neither was meditation or any of the suggestions people threw at me.  The first week of Lexapro, the nausea was very intense. But I could feel it changing my brain, and it was such a weird yet hopeful feeling.  For three years, I had my life back. I was able to travel and enjoy taking risks without crippling anxiety. At the three year mark, my Lexapro stopped working. I haven't found a resolution yet, but I hope I can find another alternative that will help me feel the way I have these past few years.",9,83,1
"Lexapro","Gail","February 13, 2020","-","I started on  Lexapro in November on 10 mg dose. Then January  moved up to 15mg, and I am now  at 20mg dose. I feel and always felt horrid.  Diarrhea and achy and nausea. The docs say each time that I increase the dose I should give it time  and that the side effects will get better. I don’t know what to do. Help me  anyone have these side effects and do they go away.",0,34,1
"Lexapro","Anonymous","February 12, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Lexapro just did not work for me. Took it for three years and it did nothing to help my anxiety and depression - I  still had anxiety attacks and I got angry to the point of breaking things. I cried a lot. Had diarrhea a lot too. Finally switched to Effexor and it’s been 100 times better. Everyone’s bodies react differently but lexapro just wasn’t for me.",1,22,1
"Lexapro","Mulls","February 12, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Been on lexepro for 6 weeks now no side effects but a little bit of a runny nose otherwise nothing been noticing a little bit of relief from anxiety slowly but surely can't wait for week 8 but otherwise it's been good",8,23,1
"Lexapro","Lisa","February 8, 2020","-","When I first started Lexapro the only side effect I had was twitching very badly. Went away after like 2 weeks. It didn't help at all. I don't take it any more cause I felt it made me worse. When I wouldn't take it for like 3 days I had TERRIBLE TERRIBLE withdrawals. Obviously you're not supposed to miss days. I've been off it for about 2 months now. I have problems I never had before taking lexapro. Everyday I got electric shocks through out my body and if I move my eyes to fast I get the shocks. I don't think I'll ever be the same before taking lexapro.",2,35,1
"Lexapro","Aaron","February 4, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Since I have been on lexipro I can feel a significant change in how I react to my anxiety, my habits, and how it has helped with my digestion and IBS (super happy with this random bonus!).  The easiest way for me to explain my overall state on lexipro is that when I feel my anxiety rising, I am more aware of it and am able to pull myself out of a spiral. For me, that is the best part.  Because of the lessened anxiety, I also have fewer IBS flare ups.",10,46,1
"Lexapro","Livelaughlove","February 2, 2020","-","I have been dealing with anxiety my whole life but have tried to go the natural route but nothing ever worked. It was affecting my marriage the way I was with my kids and work. So I finally did something about it and I’m so glad I did! My Dr. prescribed my Lexapro 10mg. The first week I had slight nausea, diarrhea and no appetite but I did start feeling more calm. Lexapro helped me so much. I could drive without feeling anxious, go to work events with confidence. I was better with handling situations at work and at home. Unfortunately the downside for me was I ended up gaining 15lbs within 5 months. It definitely slowed down my metabolism. It was easy to gain and no matter how much healthier I tried to eat I could not lose the weight. I have been slender my whole life so this was making me feel so depressed about the way I looked. So sadly I had to stop taking it. I highly recommend Lexapro I just happened to be that 10% side effect that it could cause weight gain.",8,39,1
"Lexapro","Timbo323","January 30, 2020","-","Hi, I’ve been on 10mg of Lexapro for 3+ weeks and still having side effects or anxiety attacks.  Shaking hands, burning feet and mouth.

"Lexapro","Saker","January 23, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was prescribed Lexapro after my constant, full body shaking and dizziness had no reasonable cause and I have a family history of anxiety. The first week is absolutely the worst. I couldn't eat, sleep, shaking got way worse, felt like passing out, dizzy, restless legs, unable to concentrate. Be warned, you need to take a week off work before starting this stuff. After a week a lot of the problems went away. I had a day without any shaking in my body or dizziness, then it came back, then went away again. It will work eventually, just stick with it.",7,50,1
"Lexapro","Mixed-Files","January 18, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medication Lexapro has been pretty good to me. I had diarrhea and fatigue for the first few days, but that went away. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, GAD, and Agoraphobia. I thought that nothing could ever fix my anxiety, but this has done wonders. It's almost miraculous. My anxiety is 90% gone! It has allowed me to start living my life. The only thing this could use some work on is helping my depressive episodes. But paired with Abilify, I'm doing a lot better than before.",9,30,1
"Lexapro","Haddy","January 15, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My husband started 5mg of Lexapro about 8 weeks ago. He has anxiety, panic attacks and some OCD tendencies. He had side effects at first, slightly increased panic attacks and anxiety. Started feeling better though after the first week. Not as good as he wanted so he went to 10mg and had a relapse of side effects but to me the panic attack seemed slightly less severe and passed quickly. It has been a month on the 20mg and he has had several bad panic attacks and some increased anxiety. We were really worried about this but then did some more reading and it seems that it was common for people to have this happen after a month but it passed. I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this happen after a month of starting and if they continued. Did it get better and how long until it passed.",8,33,1
"Lexapro","JJ","January 14, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Anxiety was so much better immediately but my teeth started to hurt, broken blood vessel in my finger,  my shoulders and down my arm had severe pain, my hip was severe pain,  I guess my joints were hurting terrible everyday getting more pain so I had to stop taking lexapro. I took lexapro maybe 15 years ago and didn't have this problem,l exapro the brand cost $100.00 so I chose the generic so maybe thats why its so different for me this time",3,16,1
"Lexapro","Kayla","January 13, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Well, I got prescribed this because I’m a self proclaimed hypochondriac and I'm constantly in fear of having a serious illness. Also I had been hospitalized for severe panic attacks. I just took my first dose today (10mg) with food. As soon as I took the pill I got mildly nauseous and had to lay down. About 3 hours later I felt sooo nice kind of like I was high just an overall good feeling and a little drowsiness Then a couple hours later the nausea returned but with a horrible headache almost felt like I had the flu and made me check my temperature (no fever). Now I’m laying in bad unable to sleep because I feel sick and I have muscle twitches. Hope this wears off or else I’m going to stop it immediately.",5,22,1
"Lexapro","Landbine","January 5, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started on this drug on my doctor's advice to ease the anxiety that was occurring from taking blood pressure medication. I wish I would have found it year's earlier, even before the blood pressure medication highlighted my anxiety. It took about 2 weeks to start kicking in. It negates anxiety and enables me to deal with what is in front of me far better. Plus, silly or repetitive, negative thought loops cease and I get over things that upset me way faster and easier. The only negative for me is that I know I am on something. The positives far outweigh this negative and my doctor says after about a year she will wean me off and hopefully my serotonin levels will remain at a higher level, so I don't have to be on it forever.",8,68,1
"Lexapro","CC","December 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Lexapro has saved me! I didn’t want to take any medication, but heightened anxiety and a couple panic attacks made it difficult for me to enjoy life — so much that I was becoming depressed. The first week on Lexapro was awful! Increased anxiety, a clouded feeling, and tiredness! And at the end of week 2, I had a day of high anxiety. But I’d read other reviews that encouraged me to push through! I’m so glad I did! I’m at week 4 on a dose of 5mg Lexapro and I’ve had no more panic attacks and anxiety is greatly reduced/manageable. I’m looking forward to how I’ll feel in another 4 weeks! No side effects have remained after the initial week or two. I did find it made me sleepy taking it in the morning, so I just changed to taking it at night which solved that problem. Hang in there if you’re just starting it and it’s rough. It will get better!",10,93,1
"Lexapro","cynicaldemiurge","December 30, 2019","-","Was diagnosed with anxiety recently and prescribed Lexapro. First few days felt weird, started getting headaches, brain fog, libido gone. These were common effects so I kept it going. I noticed my anxiety was gone, but I couldn't cry either. I was emotionally numb and had no empathy for others. 8 days in I started getting suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind I start this for anxiety and NOT depression/suicidal thoughts! I was very scared of myself as it felt like a second conscience was forming in my brain, one that'd tell me I'm worthless and ugly, and I'd argue with it with my normal conscience. 3 days into these new thoughts the more I was on it the more this depressive conscience took over, and I was forming ways on how to commit suicide. I was too scared to continue at this point so I stopped and my anxiety is back but I have not gotten suicidal thoughts since. And this was all only on 5mg. As said by my doctor, please halt using this drug immediately if you get suicidal thoughts.",3,25,1
"Lexapro","Andygh","December 21, 2019","-","Life saver. First week  on Lexapro ain’t easy. I felt every single emotion within five minutes. All day long. But once you're through with that, life starts being bright again. I experienced few side effects, which are nothing compared to the anxiety I had. If you’re just starting and you feel liken it’s getting worse, push through it, it gets better!",9,78,1
"Lexapro","Brian","December 19, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I developed sleep anxiety, which is absolutley awful. After  experiencing insomnia I developed an anxiety at the thought of sleep. Even the approaching evening would trigger it. I felt hopeless. It led to depression and suicidal thoughts. I was put on lexapro a eventually went up to 15 mg. It helped me reclaim my life. It put my anxiety at bay so I could change my life. It took about 6 weeks for the drug to really start working along with minimal side effects. It has been a year and I am currently tapering off the medication because I feel I do not need it anymore. It is a good drug! Allow some time for it to kick in. Also, use the medication as a tool. Mental health is about balance. Find ways to change your life/ mentality. The Lexapro is a tool to help with the big picture. There is light on the other side of the storm! Never lose hope and FIGHT for your life!",10,122,1

After 3 weeks, it feels like my anxiety is 50% less.  You start noticing the positive effects w/in a few weeks.  Keep taking it - it's worth it.

"Lexapro","LB","December 17, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I switched to Lexapro from Zoloft, because the zoloft seemed like it was not working and making me gain weight. Lexapro is working much better for anxiety/depression. Also seems like it may easier to lose weight. Does not feel strange when I have a few drinks in moderation. Potential downsides- sometimes can feel apathetic/empty of emotions. Urge to eat (all SSRI's) Overall, would highly recommend especially for those with crippling anxiety.",8,33,2
"Lexapro","Grateful53","December 14, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have to say that the past few years my anxiety has been so awful and I tried CBT and Biofeedback with little success. I have always been anxious but when I had an episode of Afib it unleashed my anxiety to the point where it was making me afraid of everything. My MD put me on 10mg and within a week I felt so much better. I was really tired in the beginning but I am so grateful that I found this medication. Everyone is different, but for me no bad side effects and amazing relief.",10,47,2
"Lexapro","KHM","December 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Saw GP because of now and again mild anxiety and mild depression.  Started with 10mg for week 1, then upped to 20mg (appears dose is far too high far too quick for an extremely mild case of anxiety and depression).  GP stated only side effect to worry about was decreased libido. 6 weeks later my partner of 6 years kicked me out of our home and terminated our relationship - I had become increasingly aggressive and volatile.  I am also a diabetic with glaucoma problems in my eyes and I am pedantic about my eye health and keeping both eye pressures stable - they have been for the last 5 years.  Once I read about the bad side effects, I immediately had my pressures checked - both eyes had skyrocketed to dangerous levels.  Have slowly weaned off these pills over a period of 8 weeks with my eye pressures slowly retuning back to acceptable levels and have been free of this horrendous chemical for 3 weeks now.",1,17,2
"Lexapro","Cia","November 21, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been dealing with anxiety for a few months now. Initially went to the ER a few times not know what it was. Then was told it could be anxiety and took Lorazepam (prescribed from the ER doctor) which worked amazingly! Then went to a primary care doctor and was prescribed 10mg of this medication Lexapro. After 2 hours of taking the medication I had a terrible panic attack with a fast heartbeat, super fatigued, dizziness, sweats and a little lethargic. The doctor wanted me to cut the pill and half and continue taking it but I am way too afraid and would rather not deal with those side effects and just deal with my anxiety and self heal.",2,22,2
"Lexapro","Jump84","November 11, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been on other SSRIs which were ineffective, however I found Lexapro to be intolerable.  Other SSRIs had their minor side effects for the first couple of weeks such as strange dreams, nausea, etc., however, Lexapro wreaked havoc on me from day 1.  Just 4 hours after taking my first 10mg dose (at 8am), I wanted to vomit, was very dizzy and felt confused and disoriented.  I also had an extremely dry mouth.  By 5pm that evening my anxiety had gotten 10 times worse, and I suffered the absolutely WORST panic attack I have ever had in my life.  My panic was so bad I briefly passed out.   Everyone reacts differently to different drugs, so this is just my experience.  However, I personally find this to be the worst SSRI in terms of side effects, which are intolerable.",1,30,2
"Lexapro","MelS","November 10, 2019","-","Initially was prescribed Xanax 20yrs ago after I started having panic attacks and anxiety which led to agoraphobia and social anxiety. Xanax was fantastic and I soon resumed living normally on a low dose of only 1mg a day. Eventually I stopped taking it all together however I always had a script for them and would take 0.5mg for flying, or would take it to help sleep.  More recently I have had some general stresses and spoke to my doc about my lack of sleep and anxiety. He suggested taking Lexapro to help with this. I started with a 1/4 of a 10mg tab for the first 4 days. Then moved up to half a tab for 6 days. And tomorrow I start a full tablet. Though I’ve only just started, I’m happy to report no side effects and I do believe I am already reaping some benefit. I'm sleeping well at night and I don’t seem to be as moody as I can sometimes be. I’m actually looking forward to increasing to the full 10mg. That’s unlike me. And I like this change. I’d recommend it to others.",9,54,2
"Lexapro","BUDDY","November 8, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Lexapro has worked wonders for me with absolutely zero side effects. I have noticed my anxiety attacks and need for xanax decreased to almost zero since I started this drug. It has almost entirely cured my anxiety and the resulting depression and I have a zest for life again. I never thought I'd feel like I did in my twenties again. I never realized how much of my symptoms were anxiety and depression. I had narrowed it down to just getting older. I have so much more energy and have lexapro to thank for this. Everyone reacts differently to every drug, but for me it has been a miracle.",10,103,2
"Lexapro","Clara","November 8, 2019","-","I was going in college and had never taken any type of mental medication but I had noticed that the anxiety and depression I was experiencing, both with friends and family was more or less constant throughout my life. Once I started taking the drug, I began to feel a more constant mood after about a month of 5 mg every night. I had less anxiety and more motivation to do things and maintain the relationships I had made, and also to encourage new ones. I had had mood swings severely before I had taken the drug and after I began to feel very consistent. I feel as though I can function normally, that I can have conversations with people without freaking out or worrying as much on how I came across to others. I still have worries, but they are worries over things that are easier to deal with and not earth-shattering like when I was off of the drug. It has greatly increased my desire to excel in school and life. I use it with both a healthy diet and exercise as well.",9,52,2

You won't notice the difference immediately, takes  time around 2 to 3 weeks to notice. It improved my life significantly. I'm happier, relaxed and more confident. My hands stopped shaking and I feel more control of myself now. Only issue is that it gives me headaches from time to time but minor and I got brown tongue after using it for 3 weeks. Doctor said drinking more water will help.",10,32,2
"Lexapro","Mr. HBP","November 2, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Here's my experience with this drug. Day 3 of taking 5 mg with Coreg, skin was hot and couldn't sleep. So I stopped. About a month and a half later, new doctor put me on Lexapro because Coreg screwed up my adrenal glands. Took 5 mg for a week with metoprolol, then 3 days on 10 mg and skin was itchy and burning. Ended up in ER and they gave me hydroxyzine in case of allergy. It could be the manufacturer Lupin that has a chemical in there that does damage to me. This is my experience, maybe Lexapro goes well for you. Will NOT take this ever again.",1,15,2

Only side effect I had was extreme tiredness and some yawning. I then went up to 10mg and now I’m on 20mg. I think I began to feel a difference after a couple of weeks. This medication has really helped me. I hadn’t even able to drive the freeway for 7 years due to extreme anxiety and fear.

I didn’t notice that the panic attacks came back and the break downs started.  I was increased back to the 20mg under docs supervision.   The break downs are less frequent but I noticed they are worse during my period. These breakdowns are intense. I have panic attacks and the crying is hard to stop.

The insomnia lasted almost two weeks and then I started freaking out and had my first real panic attack and that lump in my stomach of anxiousness just wouldn’t go away.  Dr prescribed 10 mg of Lexapro and 5 mg of Ambien. It took a few weeks for the Lexapro to really kick in. I’ve been taking it for about 6 months now and feel much better. It has the ability to take the edge off, although it can make you a little  non-caring  (stuff that could bother me or set me off now is ... I really don’t care, lol) No side effects for me... been a real benefit for me personally!",9,34,2

"Lexapro","Hello","October 18, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","First let me start by saying that I have tried quite a few medications for both anxiety and depression. Lexapro has been my favorite so far! I was on it for a while for anxiety and panic and I noticed my anxiety and panic drastically reduce. The first time I really noticed it was when I was sitting in my car at a red light. Before, I had HORRIBLE anxiety and panic at red lights because I felt trapped. However, I noticed one time while sitting at a red light after being on Lexapro that I didn't feel any panic at all! It was such a great feeling. Then...I did something stupid. I noticed that I gained some weight and attributed it to the lexapro. I decided to go off of it because of this and my doctor prescribed me Bupropion. HORRIBLE DECISION. That drug made me the absolute worst version of myself so I quit it cold turkey and now I am desperately wishing I hadn't quit the lexapro. I would take the slight weight gain any day over not feeling the anxiety and panic.",8,27,2

Had been off it for years &amp; anxiety came with a vengeance a few months ago. I tried everything I could think of to avoid medication. On a scale of 1-10 my anxiety was a 12. I dreaded waking up to face another day of torment. I was started on 5mg of lexapro &amp; .25 mg Xanax. It increased my anxiety &amp; I had no appetite. I was having weird feelings in my feet &amp; hands &amp; almost like electric shocks in my leg. Had my lexapro upped to 10mg &amp; switched to Clonazepam. That was 6 days ago. I had no increased side effects from the lexapro except I’m tired a lot. All the weird feelings in my feet &amp; hands have stopped. This is the best I have felt in 2 months. I wish I had started taking it sooner. I woke up today looking forward to enjoying the day. Don’t let all the negative reviews scare u. It did make things worse before they got better so try to stick it out.",6,19,2

My depression came back and my anxiety was at an all time high so my doctor decided to start me on lexapro due to the terrible side effects I had while on Prozac. I was very optimistic for this to work, but after about a month and a half I noticed no improvement, if anything my anxiety had gotten so much worse and I always felt like a robot. I would go days with no interest in anything and the days I would have emotion were just short lived. I felt like I had to fake putting on a smile, laughing, doing anything someone else would find enjoyable. After about 2 months on the medication I would wake up in the morning and violently vomit for about 10 minutes. This went on for about a week, so I decided to call my doctor and they explained that vomiting may occur. After this I had had enough of Lexapro and decided to get off it ASAP.",2,9,2

I had increased anxiety, much worse than the anxiety I was being treated for but that stopped right at the 2 week mark, overnight. I felt a lot better but still not quite where I wanted to be. I went back to the doctor at the 3 week mark and he increased the dose from 10mg to 20mg and immediately I felt a difference. I did not have increased anxiety this time like I did when I started. In fact, the first day I felt very relaxed, almost euphoric. On the second day I felt more like my old self, the anxiety and intrusive thoughts seemed to be very minor. I did have anxiety in the mornings for a while but that has started to get better also. My anxiety is nearly zero at this point and I find that I am better able to handle stressful situations.  I 100% recommend Lexapro just stick with it. The bad stuff goes away pretty quickly and after a month or so you will find yourself again.

I kept unintentionally clenching my jaw really hard and I couldn’t get comfortable. I threw up multiple times and couldn’t eat without feeling sick.

I started with half a dose the first week 5mg and then upped it to the 10 mg. But if you stick with this , I'm at a month and with behavioral therapy and lexapro...I'm living my life again and beginning to feel great again.

I took the medication for agoraphobia  caused by Xanax withdrawal. It worked great AFTER 4+ weeks. The results are up and down until about week 4. Meaning, you’ll feel worse and better on weeks 1-4. Then in week 4 it became consistent. I did get euphoria on day 3-4 but that didn’t last long. Don’t judge the medication for better or for worse in the first several weeks. Don’t judge it too soon!

Obviously, back in the 70s and 80s there wasn't much awareness regarding childhood mental health! I was told to sit still and learn to cope!  It wasn't until my 40s and suffering from debilitating panic attacks (ambulance rides, ER visits) that I finally decided I would try medication. Short term meds like Xanax make me depressed, so I wanted something daily. Wow. What a difference Lexapro has made for me! Certainly there was an adjustment period, but after nearly a year (and also having to work with the med) I am an entirely new person! No more obsessive counting or tapping, zero panic attacks. I almost had to grieve for a piece of me that is now gone. Only possible downside is that I'm not as obsessive with cleaning or my daily responsibilities (I may put things off a day or so) BUT I'll take the good with the bad as long as I don't have panic attacks!",10,47,4

For three full days I couldn't sleep or eat. I had no desire to do anything but was incapable of sitting or lying down. I was constantly in a panic because I thought my life was over. I would start crying, again something that never happened to me before. On the third day after I had stopped the drug I finally felt normal again.

My god, I wish someone had opened my eyes before. I assumed everyone felt this way but after a month on Lexapro it was a weight lifted off of my shoulders.

For the first year, I noticed some numbness in emotions. It was manageable and almost welcomed, since I’d spent so much time over thinking and feeling things. I feel like this has balanced out over time. I also take it in the morning because it would cause me some insomnia at first.

I still have issues and every day is still a battle at times but I don't know what I would do if I hadn't started on this medication.

It’s difficult to know what one is best for you and your body so often you have to try a couple of different ones before you find your fit. In my personal experience it’s worth trying a few till you find what’s right for you. Every medication is going to have side effects. For me Lexapro decreases my sex drive and causes constipation. The benefit of not having anxiety and being able to be a peaceful wife and mother is worth those two side effects for me. I have come off my Lexapro before and it’s true you will definitely have a lot of brains zaps, headache, a little irritability, and for me déjà vu. The brains zaps don’t usually last more than two months and they are harmless so you just have to ignore them. Overall I think Lexapro is a great medication but as I said before it’s different for each individual. Talk to your doctor. Therapy is also very helpful for me.",10,25,4

The exhaustion and headaches went away.  It seems like this may be common in the first week or so.  The  negative to lexapro is some issues with sex (ejaculating specifically).

Within days, I go from  anti-social nervous wreck when I'm off it, to a very rational, confident and outgoing person when I'm back on it.

It won't fix you, but it'll make it so you can actually breathe again. I used to cry constantly, isolate myself, have panic attacks so frequently I couldn't even sleep, and have horrible intrusive violent thoughts.  1. be proactive when it comes to the nausea side effect. Eat BEFORE you take the pill, and don't let yourself get hungry during the first 3-4 hours after you take the pill. Because once you get nausea it becomes harder to eat, which only makes you more nauseous. It's a vicious cycle that can be prevented. 2. ignore the negative reviews that are like I took this pill for 1 day and it caused *terrifying side effects*. They only cause more anxiety and they're highly unlikely.  3. From my personal experience, the first things to get better were the physical symptoms of anxiety. Less panic attacks, more hungry, less crying, etc. Keeping a journal is helpful to see the progression.",9,104,7

My thoughts were racing, I would pace back and forth, and I was having multiple panic attacks. I wanted to call the emergency room because I thought I was losing my mind! After suffering for a month, I spoke to my doctor and she prescribed me 10MG of Lexapro. I had every side effect including upset stomach, hot flashes, going to the bathroom constantly, insomnia, mood swings, shaky hands, loss of appetite, and nausea. After 3 weeks, my side effects are almost gone! My appetite is back, I don't have panic attacks anymore, and I'm not scared to leave the house! Please be patient with this medication.

I feel relaxed, calm and ready to take on the world, live my life like a normal person.  I’ve suffered extremely bad anxiety, stress and panic attacks for over a decade, finally decided to try a regular medication, not just take a Xanax when I feel it coming on.  This medication I understand may not work for everyone, but at LEAST if   you can, give it 6 weeks and commit to it if you’re going to try it.  Changed my life.  I will say tho, the first month was bad anxiety, headaches, naps in the afternoon and just horrible.

I lost my car, my home, my job - everything because I didn't care! I was always sleepy and could sleep 14 hours straight. I had major sexual dysfunction at 26 years. I tapered off slowly after about 8 weeks. I was left with constant dizziness weeks after to the point that I fell down the stairs.  Over a month after stopping, I'm doing well. No meds. Just making positive changes and counselling and trying to get back everything I lost in a couple of months on this med. I still have a little anxiety but I'm learning to control it.

I don't feel the need to make a big deal out of certain situations. I feel like I have more control and that I am gaining my life back. My anxiety was focused on my relationship at the time I started (constant overanalyzing, creating problems that don't exist, worried about making mistakes) which eventually got to the point that it was effecting my work ability.

Not only I noticed a difference, but everyone around me also did, saying how much more outgoing I was, and I was. It helped with my anxiety and my depression wasn’t a big issue, but as I continued to take it, my depression slowly got worse and worse. I eventually stopped going to school and missed like 3 months worth of classes, being in college this was terrible, considering most classes only allow 3-5 absences for an entire semester. Needless to say, my grades went downhill causing me to fall deeper into my depression and never leave my house. Eventually I stopped taking it and while I’m still depressed and anxious, it’s not as bad as the Lexapro made it. So I’d say for anxiety, it was a great medication, but depression wise it was absolutely terrible.",4,7,8

What a difference honestly I felt normal and could take on anything. I do believe in lifestyle change: I started 3 months ago to lose weight and I have lost 10 lbs so far. That’s because I pushed myself but was still miserable. It really is reprogramming your mind, but with the THC withdrawals Lexapro definitely saved me. Eventually I would like to get off it but it’s saving me a lot of trouble with suffering. Plus, it’s giving me so much confidence and NO more social anxiety.

All of a sudden, I was a completely different person; once an outgoing, lively, fearless girl to someone who couldn't even look up. Because of this I spiralled into a horrible depression. I think one of the scariest feelings was I would panic and a wave of helplessness would just hit me and I felt like my whole world was falling apart. After taking lexapro, I started to very gradually feel better. It was never like an on and off switch but as the weeks went by, I just slowly started feeling better/mood lift/less tense/etc. Now, I feel great and like myself again and am doing more for myself in the past few weeks than I have the past few years.

Since starting Lexapro, I have noticed a huge difference in the reduction of my anxiety, including my health anxiety.  I am happier and better able to connect with people (most likely because my anxiety has reduced a lot).  The pros definitely outweigh the cons I experienced. Cons I have heard that this medication can increase suicidal ideation, which is a big con.  I didn't have a huge depressive element to my anxiety, so I can't comment on the effects it has with depression Side effects: I have been having hot flushes, mainly at night Definitely increased thirst and dry mouth Some diarrhoea at the start, but that has settled Some waking up at 5am wide awake",9,10,9

I’ve been on lexapro 3 wks now (still at a tiny 5mg dose) &amp; saw an almost immediate improvement. My emotions have levelled out &amp; my anxiety has toned down.

For my depression it helps me not feel depressed as long, but I still felt almost as equally depressed as before just not everyday. And, most of the time I wasn’t depressed.

Also more difficult to ejaculate. The jitters which, when you already have anxiety, will only exacerbate the problem until the side effects wear off after about a week or so.

Side effects only lasted the first month . I got really tired 20 min after taking it , drowsy, night sweats. Make sure to take it with a snack, I find it hits the stomach like a rock.

Not only did I dread social interaction of any kind (talking to co-workers, going out with friends, even being around my own family) but I had experienced a panic attack on the freeway which kept me from driving anywhere far from my home for two years.  I was extremely stubborn and didn't want chemicals to change my reality.  I finally had to admit to myself that my reality sucked - bad. I'm overjoyed to report that Lexapro saved me.  It took a month for me to realize I was greeting people in passing again.  I drive on the freeway again and love being around people.  Stick with it even if you feel weird at first.

In terms of side effects, there were almost none. I got headaches right when I started and also after going on 20mg, but they only lasted a few days.

Medical guidelines now require, or at least I've been told as much by my doctor, that primary physicians are required to ask questions regarding mental health.  I was asked, Have you in the past two weeks lost interest in your normal activities?  No.  Have you in the past two weeks had thoughts of suicide?

My husband is deploying and I began experiencing panic attacks and anixiety back in May. I thought it was just me and I could brush it off or get over it. As time went on, I noticed that my symptoms became worse. I was crying everyday, worrying, panic attacks, aniexty attacks and having intrusive thoughts, which began to make me extremely depressed. I had no energy, insomnia, crying, mentally exhausted and no appetite. I finally broke down and went to my GP and told him what was going on. He recommended several different anti-depressants. I had been reading about the different anti-depressants and found that Lexapro got the best reviews. I was reluctant to begin taking meds but thought I had no choice. I know it might be premature but I feel 100% better that I did a week ago. The only side effect that I experienced was a insomnia for the first 3 nights, loss of appetite and no libido. I didn't have much of a libido to begin with, so it doesn't bother me. I didn't experience nausea like I read on other reviews. I am slowly getting my appetite back and sleep so good at night. It makes a little groggy first thing in the morning but once I get up and get going, I'm good. I take 10 mg every morning.

I've been taking Lexapro 10mg for almost 4 months now and I can confidently say the only scary thing about this medication is people's negative reviews on it. First and foremost EVERYONE is different, so everyone will react to it differently. I was prescribed it by my primary Doctor due to my severe anxiety and mild depression. Before this medication I was prescribed Celexa, but hated it. My anxiety and depression got so much worse I decided to do something about it. It came to the point where my anxiety and depression affected everyone around me and I just wasn't happy anymore.  At first taking this medication gave me some side affects. My side effects were really dry mouth, some intense dreams, and some loss of appetite. The only thing that has stuck for these few months have been the dreams. They seems SO REAL! But I can say I rather have some dreams than those scary anxiety attacks I use to get, and those depressed bed sobs. Lexapro has changed my life! Before this medication my life was hitting rock bottom. My Anxiety was so severe it took over my life. I obsessed over everything, overthought everything, felt like at any moment I was going to die. I was on edge every second. My blood pressure was always high and I'm only 24! I had this obsession of dying in a car accident, it came to a point I couldnt ride in a car with anyone else unless I was driving. If I did I would get panic attacks. My depression was also bad and also had an eating disorder. I felt like I was never going to be happy. Was never going to be happy in a relationship, or in my job, or even be able to hug my own mother again. I'm happy the people in my life noticed how much my disorders were taking over my life and helped me make a change. Lexapro helped my life. I hope my review will change yours.",10,282,15

Those effects disappear very quickly.  Do start at 5mg and slowly increase to 10 or 20mg. Ask you doctor to supplement with Buspar XL which counteracts most Lexapro side effects and further helps control anxiety and panic attacks. I don't recommend using Lexapro without Buspar.

I feel focused with clear thought now. I still laugh and feel every emotion...I just don't worry about things like I used to before Lexapro.

And, to add insult to injury, I was a new mother.  I honestly lost myself in anxiety and sadness and refused to believe I needed medication to get back to myself.  But with therapy and a six-month trial of Lexapro, I came back to being me.  I had some nausea at first, but it subsided within a week or so.  And, when it was right for me to come off the medication, I did it under a doctor's care - gradually.

Luckily, these side effects have disappeared after about a week of taking the medicine. I take 10 mg of Lexapro. Side effects appeared the first day I took the medicine. The anxiety started to subside after a week. Anxiety disappeared after 2 weeks on 10 mg. No problems weaning off the medication. I love this medicine. It gave me my life back.",10,37,24

It's not like a light bulb went off and I completely changed. I still get angry and worry but it goes away easily. You just don't care as deeply as you used to. For me it's worth it.

I'm still struggling at times with public anxiety and depression, but still feel good after I take it. Next time I think I am going to ask for another medicine.

"Lexapro","greene1797","February 16, 2009","-","I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was given Lexapro along with cognitive therapy. The first week Lexapro made me worse than I was originally. However, it worked wonders and has helped me immensely to get my life back in order.  I started on a light dosage at 10mg and in 4 weeks jumped to 20mg which is typical.  This combined with cognitive therapy has got me back on track.  I really didn't experience any side effects except feeling crappy when I first got on it.  Within 4 weeks it was fine.  To me it is like taking aspirin everyday now.",10,22,28
"Lexapro","Anonymous","February 5, 2009","-","I'm almost 40 years old and have been on 20mg Lexapro for 1 1/2 years just before the death of my mother.  The drug has been wonderful and has helped balance the stress and has limited my severe migraines.  The only concern is I gained a lot of weight and I have never had a weight problem until this drug.  The weight is settled mostly in my mid section. I am concerned with heart disease, artery problems, high cholesterol since these run in my family history.  Lexapro is amazing but factor in other health issues you could encounter on it.  I'm weighing my options to see if I am willing to risk the withdrawal effects, weight gain (I've read elsewhere it is difficult to lose the weight after going off Lexapro) or if my anxiety was because of my mother's death or everyday now.",0,19,28
"Lexapro","Dsmith99","January 16, 2009","-","For the first week on Lexapro, I felt weird; a little lightheaded, dizzy, had insomnia and some minor stomach issues but I stuck it out and I'm so glad I did. I have been taking it for 5 weeks now. I take Lexapro around 10am now as this helps prevent insomnia at night. I feel more energetic, happier and more social. I don't feel out of control or strange or anything. No side effects now. I would highly recommend it anyone to try this.",8,103,28
"Lexapro","alexie43","January 8, 2009","-","I have been taking Lexapro for 3 months now and feel great. I had severe anxiety. Now I feel like myself and can think clearly. If I get angry I only feel that way for a few minutes instead of a few days. I experienced a few side effects like dry mouth, and restlesness but those symptoms have faded. The worst side effect I have is loss of appetite. I don't mind that one so much.",9,32,28

I have always had bad nerves , but when my daughter graduated high school, I was suffering from the empty nest syndrome. Lexapro really helped me alot and the only fall back for me was my weight gain. I went from size 10 to 16 . I am going off from the medicine now and I think that I will do okay and if I ever have to go back on something it would be this. Good Luck!",10,20,29
"Lexapro","Anonymous","December 6, 2008","-","I have been taking Lexapro 10mg for 4 months for anxiety and panic attack disorder with mild OCD. The panic attacks went away completely and my anxiety was lessened. I am no longer walking around with a constant lump in my stomach and I feel stable. I had chest pains from the anxiety and they also went away after a month on Lexapro. If you experience side effects in the beginning please try to stick it out it is worth it. I had some side effects (restlessness, insomnia, worsening of panic episodes, dry mouth and sweating) but they went away after 4 weeks. The only bad thing about Lexapro is the weight gain. I gained 12 lbs in 2 months. Recently I had to up my dose to 15mg, when my dad died and I started feeling anxious again. Good luck all.",9,40,29
"Lexapro","Anonymous","November 24, 2008","-","I was slowly suffering from anxiety (through high school) and never really knew it. About 3 years ago (age 29) I began to have anxiety and panic attacks after a vet visit with my cat. I seizured from the anxiety of being in the vet office and from then on for about a year the anxiety turned into panic attacks at work, meetings, car, home. It wasn't until I finally had a full on panic attack (felt like a heart attack) and had to go to hospital that I was prescribed Lexapro. I did not want to accept the fact that I needed to take medicine for something psychological. I always tried to fight things with my mind. Over the past 2 years I am glad I was prescribed Lexapro. It has completely changed my anxiety. I still have occasionall anxiety but no attacks. Main side effect was low sex drive.",8,86,29
"Lexapro","jayzee","November 22, 2008","-","Lexapro is a good anti-depressant (I was perscribed this drug for anxiety but felt very positive after about two weeks). That being said, in my opinion it did more for my un-diagnosed depression then for my diagnosed anxiety, which is the reason for the perscription. I did rate this product a 9/10 though, because like I said it seems to be a great anti-depressant.",9,15,29

This medication is a life saver and I love it. They say 8 weeks for the full effect and sure it might re-balance your chemicals in 8 weeks, but give it a chance as it still takes a while after that for you to break out of your shell.",9,29,29
"Lexapro","M Boone 7","November 6, 2008","-","I took Lexapro 10 mg for anxiety and OCD for approximately one year. It was the best ever. I was less aggravated at the little things that go wrong in daily life.  My 5 and 6 year olds even noticed a difference.  It took about 3 weeks to start feeling better.  I decided that I did not need it anymore and could control the anxiety.  The withdrawls were bad with stopping cold turkey.  After 8 months off, I am getting back on medication.  The only bad side affect is terrible weight gain.",0,25,29

A few hours after taking the second dose I had this wave of memories from the last year that made me go wow, I've over reacted, over thought, over cried, over expected from myself and others.  It does make me a bit sleepy so I take it before bed. My appetite is more normal now where I would eat to feel better now I am only eating when I'm hungry.  It makes me thirsty and makes me yawn a lot but overall but I think this may save me and my family from my freak out moments.",9,46,29

I started on Lexapro and didn't start seeing the effects for about 6 months; but it was well worth the wait. I am the old me and couldn't be happier.

I was placed on Lexapro 10mg, but still had some social anxiety and anxiety about other things. I didn't have as much as before so the doctor increased it to 20mg. I've never felt better. Like others have said, I almost forget I have anxiety. I feel fine everyday and it's the greatest feeling in the world.

I fell into a relapse and now started on 10 mg. I would be so afraid of what to eat and if something was going to make my blood sugar to high. Now I can eat healthy but not have to worry that to much fruit will make me sick. I can have a soda every now and then. I love Lexapro.

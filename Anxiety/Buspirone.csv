I've taken this drug on and off for a few years and it kind of works - it's hard to explain. I have taken probably 15-20 anxiety and depression meds in the last 10 years and many have bad side effects, buspar had none of those other than drowsiness - the only reason I keep buspar around is that it is very mild in my book - the effect is mild but the side effects are also mild or nonexistent",0,15,1
"Buspirone","themoth","June 6, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have CPTSD and a very stressful life as a single parent. I started on buspirone 5mg 2x a day because I am sensitive to meds and wanted to reduce any possible side effects. I felt a little off stomach-wise for the first two doses but nothing intolerable. I then went up to 5mg 3x a day. Zero reduction in anxiety symptoms. Then my doc raised it to 7.5mg 3x a day. Still nothing. It feels like a placebo or something. I'll give it some stars for not giving me side effects like the SSRIs I can't tolerate. Doc said they would try the max dose soon but I'm not hopeful. I'm still having trouble falling/staying asleep, huge startle response, easily triggered and trouble focusing.",4,6,1
"Buspirone","Timtom","June 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medication buspirone was recommended to me for anxiety after taking Lamictal for around 6 months. During that time my depression got better but anxiety got worse. To combat this my doctor put me on 10mg twice a day. Unfortunately my anxiety appears to have gotten even worse and the side effects have been terrible even after 2 months. Sensations of dizziness, headache, disorientation, and disassociation occurred daily. Almost always twice a day, but sometimes up to 4 times lasting 30-45min but at most 2 hours. Abdominal pains, loss of appetite also. Physiological panic attacks have occurred daily as well. I don't act anxious but my body is seething. Heart rate, heated flushedness, agitation, fear, uncontrollable inner narrative etc. I feel awful on it and fear after quarantine this side effects will be detrimental for my job in commercial electric work with large machinery and power tools.",3,5,1

When I first started taking the buspar it would generate some level of anxiety for me because it’s a new chemical being introduced into my body. I would fight through the anxiety and keep taking the pills. After about a week I no longer had to fight the anxiety that was generated by taking buspar. I started off at 5mg and now I’m up to 30mg a day. I’ve been taking it for about 4-5 months now and have seen great progress. I know the list of  potential  side effects can generate anxiety for you by just reading them. However, the only  side effects  I noticed was a little weight gain and an increase in my sex drive.( which isn’t bad for me and my spouse). I would recommend buspar to anyone.

Physical side effects: tinnitus, dizzy spells, loss of balance, loss of appetite, weight gain, muscle cramps. Consumption of even small amounts of alcohol led to blackouts and (uncharacteristic) volatile outbursts. Work performance declined quickly, conflicts at home emerged. Stopping this medication led to improvements in productivity, focus, impulse control, physical energy/stamina, memory. Brief periods of tension also re-emerged.",2,29,1
"Buspirone","Better","February 25, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Buspar from what I read is for anxiety directly related to over thinking. This is what causes my anxiety. It’s chronic. I’ve read reviews that it doesn’t work, but maybe other people get anxiety from triggers. I just constantly over think everything to the point I avoid certain situations because I fear the outcome. This drug has allowed me to overcome this and talk about issues I have with someone, resolve issues faster, be more productive, etc. it’s drastically changed my life. Friends say I’m more cordial. Basically makes you feel very calm and more carefree and to stop thinking 24/7 about silly things",0,198,1
"Buspirone","Rooster","February 25, 2020","-","After 6 months of meth use my brain chemistry changed dramatically. I went from a successful sales team manager to a mental wreck who couldn’t stand in line at a store for 2 minutes without having a panic attack. After a brief hospitalization I finally decided it was time to fix it. So I saw a psychiatrist who put me on buspar. With my history of drug abuse, he decided to steer clear of benzos. Prozac, which I had successfully taken in the past, made my anxiety 10x worse. After taking my 1st dose of Buspar, my shaking ceased. I’m quite familiar with the placebo effect and I guarantee you that was not what was happening. Even though all pharmacology info available says it’s not immediately effective for acute anxiety, it worked wonders for me. Maybe it’s the  re-wiring  of my brain after the meth use, maybe I’m just nuts. So far, it has re-introduced me to life’s pleasures. I even  felt positive ASMR (Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)) effects  for the 1st time in years.",10,51,1

I've been on several of the benzodiazepine group before for anxiety (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) and the only advantage to those is that you can take as needed for anxiety and they work quickly. They are also highly addictive. Buspar is not addictive but must be taken regularly--not just for an anxiety attack. It doesn't work for an immediate attack. But if you take it regularly three times a day you won't have anxiety and you won't need the benzos. I think it is wonderful!",0,64,1

"Buspirone","Anonymous","March 15, 2009","-","At first I thought my doctor gave me a placebo since I am usually very sensitive to medicines and will have every side effect listed. Started with 5mg three times a day. Noticed that after a few days that my daily tension headaches were gone and my energy level had increased. After two weeks the tightness in my throat eased and palpitations were much better. 12 weeks later I feel really good, alert, much calmer, no headaches or palpitations. My energy level is wonderful, not that nervous energy (GAD sufferers know what I am talking about). I don't feel the need to nap any longer. It's quiet in my head and I love it. Will take this medicine for as long as I can. This medication takes a while to kick in, so please try to stick with it for at least 8 weeks, it's worth it.",10,47,33
"Buspirone","Overanalyzer","March 11, 2009","-","<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 For acute anxiety this is AMAZING. Rapid racing heartbeat. Excessive sweating. Constant worrying. Over-analyzing. This medicine basically at 15MG gives you a feeling like you just drank a six pack and ate an amazing meal.  I take it with xanax and cymbalta. Buspar is the best non habit forming short term medicine to get your life back on track when life gets overwhelming.",0,326,33

"Buspirone","Stones","March 1, 2009","-","<b>BuSpar (buspirone):</b>			 Prescribed BuSpar for anxiety and panic disorder.  This medicine seems to be a much better option for me than the SSRI drugs.  The side effects experienced are dizziness, tingling in the fingertips, vivid dreams and the occasional stomach ache.  Been taking 5mg, 5 times a day. I do also compliment the medicine with the occasional 0.25mg Xanax when needed.  After 3 weeks I do notice a big difference in the amounts of anxiety and a elimination of symptoms, which used to work their way to the panic stage. So far between these medicines, daily exercise, self education, and therapy I seem to be making some progress. I would recommend giving it a try.",0,124,33
"Buspirone","Anonymous","February 28, 2009","-","This tiny pill has been a God send for me after years of trying different antidepressants and benzodiazepines for my GAD and occasional panic. Honestly, I had little hope that Buspar would work. My starting dose was 5mg twice a day and I stayed there. This medicine had an impact on my health from day one. A few hours after taking my first dose I noticed my ever present palpitations had ceased. By day 2 my daily headaches were 90 percent better. By the end of week one the lump in my throat was gone. Now, after 6 weeks I am calm, energized, friendly and very patient with my daughter, family and friends. I have also lost 11 pounds. My head is clear, my thoughts are 'normal' and I feel focused. I LOVE Buspar! No side effects for me.",10,49,33

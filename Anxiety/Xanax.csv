"Xanax","kappa kappa gamma","May 31, 2020","-","I’ve had benzodiazepine prescriptions (ativan, k-pin, &amp; xanax) since 15 y/o until now (20 y/o). Over the past 5 years, it’s been rough managing physical and psychological dependency issues. I’ll blackout for a week at a time and proceed to buy fake xans from friends (usually cut with fentanyl and other bad stuff). During my attempt to wean off the drug, I ended up having a grand mal seizure at a party (Dec. 2019). Since then, managing sobriety from all benzos has lead to self medicating through other substances  (cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, kratom, norcos). I was living in my sorority’s chapter house but moved into a fraternity house about 3 months ago, in which 3 brothers are active xanax users. It is really rough  Basically, if you’re prone to addiction (runs in the family, other psychiatric conditions, etc) watch out dude",3,7,1
"Xanax","Reinier","April 17, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have used Xanax for 20 years. Always taken it as needed, and it works wonderfully, no side effects at all, no getting used to it as evidenced by not using it for days and no withdrawal. I tried everything else suffering severe side effects like Seroquel. I only need 1mg twice a day, maybe on real panic day three times.",10,31,1
"Xanax","Noel Garnet","March 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug has saved me on a thousand occasions, from generalized anxiety to panic attacks or somatic tension, up to situations of severe insomnia where the next day I had to get up early in the morning. I have always considered it a godsend, it is an excellent anxiolytic and it is very useful also for those suffering from sleep disorders, because it does not leave heaviness or numbness the next day, due to its short duration of action in the body. My average dosage is 20 drops (0.50 mg). What can I say, to me it is the best anxiolytic!",10,33,1
"Xanax","Vin","March 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have Poliaradiculoneuropathy (when polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy occur together).  Xanax is not so great for general anxiety, but I appreciate this drug, since I discovered its off label use for my terrible neuropathy. It reduces my legs pain and stiffness by ca. 70% and set me free from being bedridden. Now I can walk several km with the help of crutches and feel more like human again. I am getting addicted to it, but I could care less.",7,24,1

"Xanax","Js","February 1, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've taken xanax to help me sleep for several years. I try to take it as little as possible so I won't get addicted. It makes me tired, even at.25 so I don't take it during the day. Luckily, I don't suffer from panic attacks very often.  I probably take it a few times a month just before bed. It works better than it antihistamines although I frequently wake up after 6 hours which is all it seems to last. I have heard about it leading to Alzheimer's though. I'm afraid of that.",9,27,1

I am not addicted to it but dependent like a person with high blood pressure is dependent on meds., or diabetic dependent on insulin, or humans dependent on oxygen.   I have had no side reactions and am 78 years old.  It has saved my life.  Try not sleeping for a week and see what happens. You will be inside your worse nightmare Why the uproar over physical dependence, I do not know.  It must come from the Gov.",10,107,1
"Xanax","sunnyrayod","January 19, 2020","-","I have been using this drug for several years for my anxiety attacks, and it great. But anxiety has been getting worse and worse especially during work which causes heart stress (thanks so much anxiety..), so my doctor is now letting me take it during my 5-day work week. It works excellently. I am so much more calm and present at work. I will say I am a lot more lethargic, and that is noticeable. But otherwise I have no side effects, so I will continue with this treatment and I am so glad that it is so effective. The good outweighs the bad for me, but I will say that if you tend to be more dependent on drugs like these, I don’t recommend it for you. I have no addiction to it and no withdrawal symptoms when go days without after taking it for multiple days in a row. So just be aware, and pay attention to your body. If you are struggling with learning the difference between wanting another dose and needing another dose, talk to your doctor.",10,41,1
"Xanax","Gomez","January 14, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been taking xanax for  10 years. Through an alcohol addiction I drink while on  Xanax not a good idea If used as prescribed  It takes away my panic attacks. I couldn't even leave the house without.  It also helped me stop drinking 3 years sober now still on xanax 1 mg 3 times daily. Some days now I don't even take it . With proper self control it saved my life. Hands down. I  had a lot of stress since quitting drinking between family members dying. This last year has been   hard to say the least 2019 was probably the worst year of my life and I stayed sober through It. No more alcohol",10,71,1
"Xanax","Vintage","January 6, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Suffered major depression and anxiety when my father died when I was 18 years of age. I constantly considered killing my self. Antidepressants and therapy had little effect on my outlook on life. But then I was prescribed Xanax. I learned to calm down and to actually take a look at my life. Just don’t abuse the drug and it works wonders.",10,50,1
"Xanax","JConrad","January 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Well, I have mixed thoughts about Xanax. On one hand, it is a very fast acting drug, and seems to be more powerful than klonopin at the same dosage (0.5mg). On the other hand, it seems to have a very short time effect, with a more pronounced knock out effect. In short: at least for me klonopin works much better.  I stopped cold turkey (not the right thing to do, I know) and had no issues at all. I had taken it for over a year for panic.  Also, it seemed to boost my appetite beyond normal levels, but I leave this as an open question as to a plausible effect.",6,21,1

I also get up multiple times to urinate due to an enlarged prostate.  I'm 51.   My wife had some Xanax and she told me to try one before going to bed.  I used it the last 2 nights.  The pills are 0.5 mg. OMG, I slept like a BABY for the 2 nights and felt so refreshed.  I also only got up once to use the bathroom.   Most nights I get up almost every hour to urinate.  That wreaks my sleep. I will not take the pill every night but I may periodically. Too bad it's not safe to take for a long period of time.",10,22,1

I’m concerned about long term use,  ( is 9 months considered long term?) Withdrawal is another fear( does replacing Xanax with another drug make any sense?)  and mostly, the dizziness that I feel almost daily, especially when standing up or getting out of bed.

I’ve been on Xanax (1mg as needed which ends up being daily but usually only at night and then I take 2) for about 7 years.  I was originally prescribed it more than 20 years ago but kept it as a security blanket.  I’ll never forget the first time I actually got the nerve to try it.   This is what normal people feel like??? , was my response.  I would keep my review at a 10 EXCEPT, now I’m hearing LOTS of talk (and medical reviews) that it causes dementia/Alzheimer’s!!!

Its definitely a life saver to have though!!",10,55,1
"Xanax","mazamamama","November 19, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have severe OCD, with accompanying anxiety and debilitating insomnia.  Xanax helps me break thought loops.  I only take it a few times per week, almost exclusively at night, and rarely during the day when I'm hit with a paralyzing bout of obsessional thought.  I take  .125 mg (half a .25mg pill).  Surprisingly, that is enough to stop the ruminating and make me a little drowsy, and that adds up to falling asleep.  Sometimes I take it in the middle of the night to get back to sleep, but only if I don't have to get up early the next day and if I didn't take it to get to sleep that night in the first place.  The way I see it, if .125 to .25 mg stops working for me, it'll be time to move on and maybe revisit Xanax at a later date.  Having tried a great many different medications, I'm beginning to think rotating treatments is the way to go anyway, to prevent tolerance, addiction, and avoid long-term side effects/consequences.",9,35,1

It made me feel so calm and more happy. But I realized after how addictive it is. Now I take Xanax up to 6mg per day because I feel is the only thing that helps me not having anxiety and panic attacks. Sometimes I just enjoy how it makes me feel. It has been very effective but I also think is dangerous. Because I don't care about the side effects but I am very scared of the thought of overdosing. I lie to people about how mg I take in a day.  Take care of your self, if you have depression. It is easily to get addicted because it gives you that empty feeling you might find pleasant.",8,43,1
"Xanax","Gotta get off these things!","November 7, 2019","-","Been on Xanax for almost 17 years for acute anxiety disorder. I also have a rare heart condition that I take meds for. Xanax was good at first but now after 17 years and up to a prescription of 6mg a day. Just came down from 8mg a day. It’s messing with me. In the past few months I’ve been experiencing what I call googly eyes followed by a headache. I’ve told my Drs and none have an explanation. So I did a test myself. Took my heart meds as usual in the morning left out the Xanax. No googly eyes. Until I took one then there it was. Dizzy ,couldn’t see straight had to lay down with a bad headache. Can you build up a bad dose in your body after taking so much for so long? I’ve only been on the 8&amp;6 mg for about 5 years. I have a family and I know I’m going to need in patient care to get off this stupid medicine. Also let me add yes I know I’m addicted and dependent but I’m scared and not sure if what to do but try to slowly ween myself off. Of course my dr is helping.",10,35,1

I got an appetite became interested in daily activities again, gave me motivation and I once again had goals set for myself. However this drug is for short term use and that's it! I was on it for several years and when I became physically dependent on it what was prescribed to me was never enough! I not only was physically dependent but also addicted! It began to cause increased anxiety, irrational behavior, destructive actions, and really bad mood swings! I weaned myself off as soon as I realized it was causing the problems in my life!

It got added to my meds due to Childhood PTSD that would not allow me to calm down and sleep. This drug should not be used alone. Other meds should be in place. If you take this drug and need to continue increase the dosage amount, this drug may not be for you. You need a diagnosis from a psychiatrist to even get this drug. You will be monitored for a long time while on it. Monthly visits to the doctor for years and years. Once you can prove that you can take this medication responsibly you may find the rules relaxed a bit. You are not to drink on this drug. I have rarely had a drink for the last 25 years.

The first day I took one I felt like I have missed my life all these years. I looked at my wife and said the following.   Have I been an A-hole for the last 13 years?  She said yes.   You must really love me  She said yes again.  For the first time in my life I realized how much anxiety took over my life. I can literally feel the difference of me being that angry anxiety filled person.  Now, I take .5 every 2 days. I actually enjoy life. Before it was just there. Like a clouded mind just floating there. Not feeling or computing. When I take a Xanax, I feel alive. Happy. I look at my kids and I can actually enjoy them and literally feel the abundance of love I have for they. And that makes life so much better to live.",10,135,2

I now can live a normal life, go to school, get FANTASTIC grades am a mother of 2. I love my daily life till my doctor passed away... now I can not find a doctor to prescribe it. I do not abuse this drug and they have no reason to want to take me off of this drug. I have been great success from this drug. I wish i could find a psychologist that would continue to prescribe this medication when it really works successfully for myself.

I was on it for about 15 years  off and on.  Since then, my physician has retired and I am now not able to find a doctor who will prescribe it.  I don’t understand why THIS drug is being so controlled when there is a whole country of alcoholics and booze still remains for sale openly in every grocery store or liquor store on every block! Alcohol caused thousands of deaths everyday from tragic car crashes and alcoholic liver failure.  Such a double standard.

"Xanax","Coffee","August 8, 2019","-","I started Xanax in my 30s after my father was diagnosed with cancer and other life events started to pile up. It helped at the beginning. I could notice the difference in my anxiety and sleep patterns. However, a year or two went by and I found myself completely hooked. I had lost contact with friends and isolated from family, I left my job and spent most of the day at home. I truly had a 180 degree change in my social life, hobbies, and relationship. I spent all day at home watching TV and listening to music. I had no desire to deal with people or any type of social interaction. I found myself avoiding everything like going grocery shopping, driving, dealing with problems. Every time I tried getting off the Xanax it would backfire. It took months for me to stop taking Xanax and it has been 3 years without it. I lost many friends and family members and my relationship ended. I have slowly built myself up.

The days I am using this medication are 100x more productive and filled with joy...I'm sick of seeing only negative propaganda about Xanax. If you are a responsible adult who uses it properly, it is not harmful. If you use a heart medication each day, and it keeps you healthy, are you addicted to that? It's the same with anxiety. Mental health is just as serious as the physical. Just because some are abusing it, doesn't mean judge those who use it correctly. I appreciate everything this med has done for me!",10,171,2

I successfully fight to not take it more often and I almost always win the fight. When I don't, I take an extra 0.25mg or 0.5mg. Meanwhile without it I would not have had a successful college teaching career , traveled to Europe 28 times, produced a cable TV show, written 3 books, had hundreds of friends who love and respect me, and even worked out at the gym where I swim, walk, and work out with weights regularly.

"Xanax","Jason h","July 25, 2019","-","It’s really hard to rate this medication because there are two sides to it, short term and long term. Short term ( 20 minutes- 4 hours) it can feel like a life saver. It will calm you down, and if needed let the pill dissolve under your tongue (sublingually) for faster results. I. This case it gets a 10/10. You should not take this medication long term (3 months max) or overuse Xanax or any benzodiazepine. You will become dependent, you will become tolerated and getting off of this medication usually requires a medical detox because of the potential of death, definitely extreme discomfort and anxiety levels off the charts. It gets a 0/10 on that side. Taking too much or drinking on Xanax is potentially fatal . Also taking it long term effects both long and short term memory severely. I recommend you take this review seriously as I have been through all of this minus death and I don’t wish my experience on anybody.",6,46,2
"Xanax","Anonymous","July 24, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I suppose ONE reason why Xanax is so addictive is because it works, and it always reliably will. (There's also a high that you get at the higher doses, but it quickly fades with ongoing use.)  A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done.  Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence. It also makes it difficult to sleep because you rebound in the middle of the night.",8,25,2

Xanax is more addictive than heroin and turns normal people into weird and angry shells of who they previously were. The drug causes the brain to stop producing chemicals it needs and the half life is so short that you go into withdrawal every time the drug  runs out  every 4 hours. You believes the feeling is  anxiety  and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how you’re acting. The longer you take the drug the worse it gets- and eventually the doctor who got you hooked on it will stop prescribing it. A safe way to get off of Xanax is the Ashton method  (Benzodiazepines How They Work &amp; How to Withdraw)- switching slowly from Xanax to Valium.

I would have NEVER SUFFERED FROM A STROKE IN 2010 DUE TO MY CONDITIONS that I had no idea there was a word for what's wrong with me. This is a quick acting short shelf life in the system type of medicine so it's a here, now, gone feeling. The low doses are like a mini invisible hug, the 2 mgs help me sleep and dream of a better life and wake up to my Starbucks  feeling alert as the medicine did it's thing on my heart and mind. If during the day I feel sick with chest pain from anxiety it offers immediate relief. I am responsible in my consumption. Thank you to the hard working medical professionals for understanding the pain of the unseen sicknesses.",10,63,4

For the first time since my teens when the anxiety began, I finally had relief. This medication has been a complete game changer for me and has improved my quality of life by 1000%. I have been taking 0.5 mg twice a day for the past 8 years and haven't had to increase the dosage.

I continued using Xanax for more restful sleep but after about 3 months I realized that short and long term memory was WAY down.   Stopped Xanax and replaced with GABA and this seems to be a far better solution.   The Wellbutrin worked great, felt more energy the first week but did take 6-8 weeks to fully kick in.

I don't know where I'd be without it. I take the use of this drug very seriously and don't abuse it. I use it only when needed for panic or when anxiety is so intense I simply can't tolerate it any longer. When used properly this drug is safe and you will not become addicted. It's very fast acting (15 min) which is important when a panic attack hits. Side effects are minimal for me. I get the jelly legs and that's about it. It's never made me stumble or fall though.

I could see how it would be good for a panic attack, but for general anxiety it is not very good. If you are on a constant dose, you will be taking them about 3 to 4 times a day which is too much to keep up with. I also found much more intense effects from this drug, which I consider dangerous because I don't want to get addicted to them.

"Atenolol","Gavilan","April 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I don’t normally have high BP or anxiety. I was prescribed atenolol 25 mg daily years ago in the midst of a divorce, by a concerned obgyn who was worried about my very high BP and stress/anxiety. I’m so glad he recommended this over anti-anxiety meds! It really helped me sleep and got me through that tough time. I appreciate its subtle calming affect that does not alter my mood. I began taking it again 6 weeks ago due to stress, and again I’m so impressed with how subtle it is and how  normal  I feel. I’m now cutting the dose down to 12.5 mg because it was making me a little too drowsy. I hope that’s a good sign that my anxiety is coming back down. Atenolol is a great option to try before heading to the heavier anti-anxiety arsenal, I think.",10,8,1
"Atenolol","Nzy","October 18, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","Atenolol has a great calming effect overall on my anxiety.  Could also exercise more.  No more anxiety, rapid heart rate, nervousness.  Better sleep/rest quality.",10,26,1
"Atenolol","Sam","July 9, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","So this has worked pretty well for me! I started on 25 mg once a day for high blood pressure, high heart rate and anxiety. So far it’s been doing it’s job, my heart doesn’t feel like it’s going to burst out of my chest and I am not 24/7 anxious anymore. While I’m taking it I don’t really realize the difference, I just feel a little calmer though when I forget a dose that’s when I freak out a little bit and realize it. I’ve only really had dizziness as a side effect, sometimes I’ll also be more tired then usual though it’s nothing dramatic. Just be cautious if you have low blood sugar, my doc said I’d be fine as long as I keep an eye on myself though it really sneaks up on you while you’re taking atenolol. I don’t realize that my blood sugar is getting too low sometimes cause I don’t get as shaky or anxious since I’m on this so that’s something to watch out for. Other then that it’s been good to me though!! It’s really affordable as well!!",8,18,1
"Atenolol","Sergeant Tubbs","June 18, 2019","-","I've suffered situational anxiety for 4 years. Every time I had to speak in a group I'd have a panic attack. My heart would pound in my chest like a jackhammer and my voice would shake. It was so embarrassing and I feared it would hurt my career.  I tried behavioral therapy and benzos to manage my anxiety. Nothing really worked until I tried Atenolol. It is an absolute Godsend. It steadied my heart rate and enabled me to not only speak in groups but also deliver presentations in front of a bunch of people. I highly recommend Atenolol for people suffering situational anxiety.  I had one bad experience in public speaking my brain had learned to flood my body with adrenal any time I had to speak in public. The fight-or-flight response in my body created a vicious cycle where I would fear being afraid. I recommend behavioral therapy in conjunction with taking Atenolol. Therapy can help you understand the root mental/emotional cause of your anxiety.",10,42,1
"Atenolol","Anonymous","February 22, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I’m on atenolol (50mg in the morning 25mg at night) for a heart condition(SVT). I only recently learned it was also an anxiety medication, which I also deal with, but I still experience a lot of symptoms (enough to have to talk to someone about) however I do notice higher heart rate at social situations if I miss a dose. taking for 3 years not this dosage tho",7,11,1

"Atenolol","JJJ","June 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Recently prescribed this med for SVT attack. Lowered my BP, heart rate and overall anxiety. Have not noticed any bad side effects and super affordable!!!",10,21,1
"Atenolol","t-dizz","February 23, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Atenolol has worked great but found I had to take it on an empty stomach or else it wasn't as effective.  When I had to go off of it due to the supply disruption, Metoprolol was not working the same and the anxiety was brutal, couple that with the fact my Doc was on vacation and I had to deal with a nurse who was just trying to stall me and my symptoms.",0,16,1
"Atenolol","Momma dog18","February 14, 2018","-","<b>Tenormin (atenolol):</b>			 I take these specifically for anxiety and it works like a dream for me. I wanted to go on something that was not addictive and I didn’t want anything that made me feel like a zombie. I wish more doctors would use medications like this as a first line treatment as it doesn’t take 4-6 weeks to get to a therapeutic level like antidepressants and there is not a risk of dependence like there is with benzodiazepines.",0,55,1
"Atenolol","Smalm","September 19, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I am a hypochondriac, I fear that I am dying of something all the time. I got on atenolol for my anxiety, I take it sometimes twice daily. I find that it lowers my heart rate which calms me down since I am not worrying what I could possibly have. I like it a lot. It is a nice small pill that I take and I have had a heart rate in the 50s from it... But it usually is more subtle and does not move the number of beats per minute that much. It makes me not worry about my pulse.",8,36,1
"Atenolol","FlightlessBird","August 17, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","Let me start off by saying that I've done my research on Atenolol--it doesn't have the greatest track record, and there's a lot of evidence coming out saying that it doesn't actually protect your heart or arteries from damage. But Atenolol is the only thing that has worked to control my heart. I used to have high BP (160/100) and tachycardia at times, but as soon as I started taking Atenolol, it was like I was normal again. And I can definitely tell a difference when I stop taking it. I get a little shortness of breath very infrequently and my pulse is sometimes under 60bpm, but it's the one drug that has worked for years. I wish I could find something better/more effective, but I haven't yet. Tried Losartan, Vasartan, and a few others.",8,23,1
"Atenolol","Rajnag","March 3, 2017","-","Can somebody explain - is it worth taking 25 mg before making any presentation or social gathering.  Kindly share",0,26,1
"Atenolol","Jwright7784","January 25, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Works very well for physcial symptoms of anxiety. Heart palps are under control and blood pressure and heart rate are now excellent. I only need 12.5-25 mg once a day. Great med.",8,50,1
"Atenolol","texaschick9187","December 29, 2016","-","I was given this in 200mg for Mitral valve prolapse and Regurgitation. I had suffered with panic attack and anxiety for years. What a gift for me...it unbeknownst to me treats anxiety... I no longer suffer from it. Nothing short of miracle to me!",10,48,1
"Atenolol","Kaynkimmom","December 18, 2016","-","I started taking atenolol (25 mg) right after Thanksgiving for heart palpitations. When I saw the Dr he said I had sinus tachycardia, but I also have severe panic disorder. I can tell a big difference. I will have a palpitation every now and then but my resting heart rate is down. I haven't noticed that my anxiety is down so I still take my .25 xanax when I need it. I also haven't noticed any side effects other than a little dizziness and a little chest tightness. Its kind of been a life saver because my palpitations would put me in a panic attack. I would recommend this to anyone that would benefit from it.",8,50,1
"Atenolol","Atenolol has been a miracle.","September 19, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","Atenolol put me back in the game. Prior to having this prescription I could only rarely drive across bridges. My work output was low because I had too many panic attacks to even go to work more than 2 days a week. Anyway its been great!",10,63,1
"Atenolol","dix888","August 23, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","was prescribed this for tremor (due to seizure Rx). had been on primadone, which worked well. atenolol caused dizziness, extreme vertigo, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, chest pains, tightness when trying to breathe. I fainted. MD told me to go off it. After fainting, called pharmacist. He said get to the ER and why are you on a beta blocker? I didn't know atenolol was a beta blocker. Not supposed to take those due to having asthma. In ER, my BP was 188/88. Usually is around 123/63. Took 4 hours, IV etc. to get BP down to 158/78. They released me but said to tell MD never to put me on betas again.",1,31,1
"Atenolol","Thankful lady","August 23, 2016","-","I have been taking the generic Tenormin (atenenol) for probably 32 years now.  25 mg.  I take it at night.  Never had a problem, EXCEPT when I could not see my doctor and had to see someone else in the practice.  He thought I should get off the drug; said there were new better things.  He took me off it and I was going on vacation the next day or so.  Worse vacation ever.  I thought I was dying.  My heart was pounding.  I thought I would die up in the mountains.  Got back on Atenol when I got back home.  Everything was normal.  If I accidently miss a day or so, I can tell the difference.  I don't know about all the side effects other people have had, but it works great for me.",10,69,1
"Atenolol","Mickarickaroozie","August 17, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was ok for many months then terrible, debilitating nausea.

"Atenolol","epikblue22","December 13, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","I am diagnosed with PTSD - two usual traits that come with PTSD are depression and anxiety. Due to the anti depressant I'm taking (zoloft 50mg) , I experienced a slight but uncomfortable raise in blood pressure which contributed to my anxiety. I saw my general doctor and qualified for atenolol 25mg. It has worked miraculously with no side effects. What I like about atenolol is that it is not digested by the same liver enzymes which digest zoloft - so there is no risk of atenolol levels competing with zoloft for bonding sites . I feel a lot calmer , and don't experience as much agitation and irritability as I used to.  Performers, over coming stage fright is part of the challenge. stop cheating .",1,34,1
"Atenolol","Notbroken","October 15, 2015","-","This is the best drug ever. I was prescribed this because I had rapid and forceful heartbeating due to panic and anxiety.

"Atenolol","Soothsayer","June 14, 2010","-","I have been taking Atenolol (50mg) for a month or so now. There was an immediate drop in blood pressure and my anxiety has lessened so that I need my Xanax much less often.  One thing I have noticed is that I wake up a few times a night with pain in whatever shoulder I have been sleeping on.  It feels like joint pain and lasts for about an hour after awakening.  Otherwise it does not effect my sleep. Another side effect is that, an hour after taking it, I yawn and my eyes water.  Also, the first two weeks I took it I had diarrhea when previous to that I was constipated, but that has subsided.",9,87,2

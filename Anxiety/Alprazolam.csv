Over the past 5 years, it’s been rough managing physical and psychological dependency issues. I’ll blackout for a week at a time and proceed to buy fake xans from friends (usually cut with fentanyl and other bad stuff). During my attempt to wean off the drug, I ended up having a grand mal seizure at a party (Dec. 2019). Since then, managing sobriety from all benzos has lead to self medicating through other substances  (cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, kratom, norcos). I was living in my sorority’s chapter house but moved into a fraternity house about 3 months ago, in which 3 brothers are active xanax users. It is really rough  Basically, if you’re prone to addiction (runs in the family, other psychiatric conditions, etc) watch out dude",0,7,1

I stopped  Juuling (electronic cigarette)  again and the anxiety was even worse than it was before. I was having panic attacks daily that lasted for hours. My mind was I'm the darkest place. I even started to smoke cigarettes again to take off some of the tension. The only thing that made me feel better was alprazolam! I split a .25 into four little pieces and take them as needed (that is how it was prescribed to me.) I hate admitting this, but it’s really a miracle drug.

On one hand, it is a very fast acting drug, and seems to be more powerful than klonopin at the same dosage (0.5mg).

While I am not physically dependant on the drug (there are times I can go days or a couple weeks without taking any), I do admit I am very psychologically dependant.

(There's also a high that you get at the higher doses, but it quickly fades with ongoing use.)  A significant problem with Xanax and all others benzos is the amotivational symptoms that results from chronic use. It certainly becomes increasingly hard to perform basic tasks, as one feels TOO relaxed to get anything done.  Even more serious of a problem with Xanax in particular is its rebound effects that make the symptoms WORSE than before. Because Xanax is so powerful but short-acting, within just a couple, or maybe a few, hours of taking it, one feels the URGENT, overwhelming need to take more. It can quickly form dependence.

The drug causes the brain to stop producing chemicals it needs and the half life is so short that you go into withdrawal every time the drug  runs out  every 4 hours. You believes the feeling is  anxiety  and take another pill to treat it! However the feeling is just withdrawal. You will need more and more of the drug just to get the original effects and you will not really be aware of how you’re acting.

It should not be used as a sleeping aid, since it tends to lose its hypnotic effects after some time of continuous usage. To avoid the tolerance and addictive issues, I recommend people to only take alprazolam in or before moments of anxiety. For cases of social anxiety, I recommend one to take alprazolam, 2 hours before social interaction. The dosage is, in my view, subjective, thus one should discover his optimal dosage, on an incremental basis.

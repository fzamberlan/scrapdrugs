"Valium","shapel","June 3, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Valium is a drug that can be a life saver or destroyer. This drug for me helps me as long as I have it under control. I find myself always having to be wary of my dosage. This allows me to pretty much go about my normal life, allows me to function, think and gives me the motivation and willingness to do the things I need to do. When on these and under control I find a lot of aspects of my life all coming together where as without it I feel helpless. Too much valium daily however leads to depersonalisation and impulsiveness. Before you know it you will be turning into something else, it is only in hindsight that this becomes apparent. As quickly as this can help improve your life it can crumble it. CONTROL YOUR DOSAGE. So if you can control yourself absolutely I would recommend but be wary it is very easy to lead yourself down the path of a benzo addiction, I have done this become clean and reused several times now.",8,9,1

"Valium","Quinn","February 9, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been on Valium since 2011 after the sudden passing of my husband. I have always had severe generalized anxiety and was never adequately treated for it, just given seroquel which made me non-functional.  The loss of my husband exacerbated the anxiety condition and I began suffering from insomnia as well. My Dr tried me on a variety of benzodiazepine meds which didn’t last long enough in my system to give me adequate relief. We eventually gave diazepam a try and it worked so well. I started on 20mg a day and over the years I have tapered to a comfortable dose of 10mg daily. It does not make me sleepy or loopy but takes the edge off enough that I can care for my children and function in daily life. Yes there is a bit of a dependence but for me it’s worth it to be somewhat addicted rather than struggle to cope with terrible anxiety symptoms every day. I do recommend Valium as an effective anxiolytic however I would say to be aware of the potential for abuse and dependence.",10,75,1

I can function I  am way more productive &amp; I actually get out &amp; talk to people which is normally a no no for me. I also get a great appetite which I don't have if I don't take any.  I was under a great Psychiatrist for many years until he retired I then had to move to the country where it was extremely hard to even find a GP but I finally did but have had to go private &amp; he has put me onto a barrage of new Dr's to see in the New Year who are all private as well so I am stressed about paying for all of these at the moment &amp; getting the new GP to give me any Valium is like asking for his kidney but on 2 rare occasions he has given ten 10mg Temazepam's which did help but I had to stretch them out.",10,39,1

I was on it for 8 months and it worked as directed,I was very happy but started reading about PAWS (Post-acute-withdrawal syndrome) and started to wean down well anxiety, panic attacks and confusion hit me like a ton of bricks. Bupernephrine is a horrible drug to get off of. I would rather have gone thru full opiate detox than those. Tried Klonopin, Xanax both were a waste and very addicting! But I was tried on  one 10 mg Valium and I have not felt that normal in ages. I am very leary of any pharmaceutical and don’t take it daily sometimes I put it away for a month. It has truly given my life back but I’m still on a drug. I want to be off everything and I don’t know if that will ever be.

"Valium","DJ","December 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This drug almost killed me, as did the psychiatrist who prescribed it.  In early 2017 I started with this new doctor who completely changed my psych regimen after a difficult move and sudden loss of a sister to a drug overdose. He started me on low dose Valium. It did work, but right away problems were showing.  Soon enough I was hooked and popping these like life savers. My wife expressed concern about it, and what did the doctor do? He increased the dosage and quantity. Soon I was getting through the day with up to thirty pills. I experienced multi organ failure earlier this summer, and subsequent heart failure.  My primary doctor recommended a new psychiatrist, who was shocked at my regimen. He said he wouldn’t see me until I had beaten the addiction. It was tough. He has since switched me to buspirone, although maxed out at 60mg.  Valium may work in the short term, but just don’t do it. It’s a destroyer.",2,18,1

This medicine actually made my anxiety worse! I literally felt like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t sleep at night because my fight or flight response wouldn’t stop rushing through my body and It made me have horrible panic attacks. It got to a point I had to call the EMS because my heart rate went up to 170....I was excited to try the medicine from the reviews because I wanted the relief and calm mind but I will never take this medicine again.",1,17,1

"Valium","Magwell68","September 26, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","In 2015, my surgeon gave me 10mg Valium to help with post-op anxiety. I took it twice, but 10mg  knocked me out, so I’d split the pill and take 5mg. I also have severe anxiety and depression and am prone to panic attacks, but I’d never taken meds for it (never asked). I had a couple panic attacks during recovery, took 5mg Valium, and it was like night and day. In 15 minutes I felt calm, relaxed and  normal  again. I rarely have panic attacks now, but my anxiety can be severe, so I’ll take a 1/4 pill (2.5mg), and it takes the edge off. I find the effects last for quite a while, and rarely have to take more than 2.5mg/day, and rarely take it more than 2 days in a row. I feel  normal  most of the time, but when my anxiety is too high, I’m glad I have it to take the edge off.  I don’t have an addictive personality, so I don’t know if I’d ever feel like I  had to  take it to feel good, I just take it when nothing else is helping my level of anxiety go down.",10,131,1
"Valium","Pleasebecareful","September 14, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Valium is a great anti-anxiety medication, but please be aware and take the medication very sparingly, like if you are going out or driving or going to a gig ONE TIME. Whatever you do, DON'T take these pre-emptively and NEVER EVER take these daily. 2.5mg of Valium for once-off anxiety is great. Use it no more than ONE time for ONE month, and you should be fine. I recommend not using Valium for more than two days in a row, otherwise you will get addicted, and Valium is a nightmare to get off of if you are addicted. You will need to slow taper off of it if you have been taking this long-term, and this can take months or years. Check out Benzo Buddies for the horror stories. Don't drink any alcohol whilst taking this either, as both substances potentiate each other, making both stronger. Please, please be careful.",4,45,1
"Valium","BS1976","August 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","After taking Xanax off and on for years, I developed a problem with it making me more anxious when it wore off, like a lot of heart palpitations, sweating, fear. I was switched over to Valium 6mg for two years and then advised to withdraw to see how I went. I’ve spent the last six months tapering and been off for 7 weeks and I’m miserable. I have returned PTSD and depression. So, I guess I didn’t go well and am going to reinstate 2mg a day to get my life back. When I take it I have no side effects and feel alive. I didn’t hit tolerance before. I say yes to Valium if you need it to feel normal and don’t abuse.",10,79,1

I'm very concerned with anyone taking it everyday as I think this is begging for problems with addiction and tolerance.  I've gone without it for over a month so I think the take it only as needed is the best way to avoid addiction.  For those saying things like never take a Benzo?

The tragedy lasted 3 years, and I quit valium cold-turkey.  I stayed in bed 8 months, and learned the meaning of the phrase pray without ceasing.  Literally.  For those who need some kind of timeline, I speak from experience that withdrawal eased up after 8 months. God willing, I will never touch benzos again.

Then, I have a big break, try to use some of the CBT techniques I learned, then again, when it gets too much. It saved my ass many times.  In the meantime drink herbal teas (Melissa, nettle, Valerian) and try to exercise (walking, cycling) and eat healthy foods (lots of vegetables, fruit in moderation and organic meats, nuts, seeds, unpasteurized cheese, etc.).

I use it as a last resort only when I can’t calm myself down, so I am definitely not addicted. I only have to take it a few times a month. For me 2 mg can keep me calm for 2 To 3 days.

I soon got my own RX and over the years I was up to 4mg a day and my anxiety wasn’t improving. A very incredible psychiatrist told me it was now just harming me and my tolerance was far too high and he amazingly got me off Kolonopin to taper with Valium because of the longer half-life. I’m now down to 12mg a day (from the converted 60!) and it’s been hell. I’ve never been so anxious and  depressed. Though this is SADLY normal with tapering. I’m working with therapists and trying to keep on a schedule of exercise and deep breathing but I fear I’ll never be able to break free from these terrible drugs that are killing me.

At first you may have the sedated effect before you become more resistant to the drug. Where you get the drug also makes a difference.

I'm going through some withdrawal like tinnitus and night time sweats but I wake up better and have been feeling happiness. I strongly recommend staying off any benzodiazepine and if you are going to take it, only for bad panic attacks. Never take them daily as they are very addictive and quite difficult to get off of.

These days I need 15mg for that same affect.  Its a shame. And I thought I wasn't abusing it because I didn't take it daily. (Generally 2 or 3 times a week, depending how I felt).

Also if you take it even every few days, it pretty quickly becomes less effective meaning you may have to increase the dose. I now take 10mg as needed.

Many of us, can become overly reliant on medication, so I feel a holistic approach is needed for real, long term results. However, for moderate to severe anxiety/panic attacks, Valium is INCREDIBLE.

I do find that taking one before bed helps me relax my 100-miles-per-hour brain (stupid racing thoughts &amp; worries) plus my muscles don't get all kinked up in knots while I'm sleeping.

Even though I was on in for several months, addiction or overdose was never a problem for me. However, I don't like taking pills generally, especially very often.

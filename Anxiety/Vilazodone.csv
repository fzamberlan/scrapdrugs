"Vilazodone","Paila","February 26, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Less sleepiness. I feel more energetic and am focusing better.  My function is better. Not depressed or down even with 10 mg a day. However, It does not cover my anxiety and an hour after I take it, I start having worries and butterflies.  It kind of makes me tense, but definitely targets depression and psychomotor retardation.",7,0,1
"Vilazodone","Cookie","February 7, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My experience was mixed.  I suffer from anxiety and depression.

"Vilazodone","Daneel","November 20, 2019","-","Bad experience taking this drug vilazodone for anxiety and depression.  1) Side effects starting it were mostly stomach upset and some headache.  Not too bad. 2) Switched from Lexapro to this, then on Viibryd 20 mg for 1 month. At first I thought it was working, but as time went on my anxiety got worse.  It got much worse than it had ever been without medication.  My depression got worse as well. It got to the point where some days I would feel intense anxiety all day, couldn't eat, and had to take a clonazepam just to calm down enough to sleep.  3) Getting off of this medication was so hard for me. Dropping down from 20 mg to 10 mg, over four days I went from irritable, to moody, to severely depressed and crawling out of my skin.  I went right back up to 20 mg, and over the course of a couple of days those severe side effects went away. Eventually got off it, but very slowly.",1,3,1
"Vilazodone","Dee","September 28, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started on viibryd September 24 on 10 mg. I am currently day five on 20 mg. So far no tangible changes. My anxiety is through the roof because of work and this hasn’t made a dent in it. My sleep is ok, the nausea is awful and increased because I’m anxious. I’m hopeful though. I been off and on meds since I was 16. Zoloft for years! Tried Paxil which was horrid. Escitalopram probably has been the best anxiety wise, but it too ran it’s course. I tried it with abilify but that wasn’t good either. Can anyone post if they tried something that really made a difference for high anxiety? Currently I  dread each day, cry uncontrollably and am a constant state of fight or flight.",1,6,1

My biggest concern taking SSR's is the sexual side effects. Viibryd had the same effect, unfortunately. I was very hopeful and sadly disappointed. I took Viibryd for 3 weeks, with sexual side effects after one week. One top of extreme nausea and insomnia almost instantly. I could have managed the nausea and insomnia, but no way I can manage a healthy marriage with no orgasm, EVER.

"Vilazodone","manonthemooon","September 6, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Started out on a trial pack of  vilazodone 10mg first week, 20mg second week until insurance approved coverage. Most noticeable side effects were: feeling sick, diarrhea, having to urinate more often, agitation/anger, worse memory and I occasionally had sleep issues on it. These side effects for me amplified when moving on to the 20mg. I'd recommend anyone considering this medication to really review other options, while on this medication even for just a short while, I've developed trust issues with others, and anger that I never displayed while not on this medication. It did seem to help my anxiety symptoms for about the first week (could completely be placebo effect), but since my anxiety has only gotten worse, and in-turn has made my depression come back. However this is just my experience, many others have had different positive experiences, and you could too.",2,5,1

I feel calmer and have more insight to my problems instead of catastrofying everything.  I had a really bad spring where I really alienated my daughter with obsessive anxiety. I'm not sure why I took it so long. I guess when you are in the middle of something you don't see it.  I still have anxiety but I'm calmer.  I'm on 150 mgs of Lamictal.

Doctor switched me to VIIBRYD with two sample packs. I weaned off Lexapro with half dose for 1 week, while simultaneously taking VIIBRYD. Had diarrhea for the first week off and on. Within 8-9 days my thumb started to have involuntary twitching. That lasted 3-4 days, then muscles throughout my body started to twitch once per 20 to 60 seconds. When I go to bed I get jerks that make it hard to actually fall asleep. Dreams are abnormal and distressing.

"Vilazodone","Pocket Rockets","March 3, 2019","-","I suffer social anxiety and depression, and after taking Viibryd for 20 days, I've had to quit. It's raised my social anxiety immensely, plus it's caused GAD - which I've never had before. It also caused nausea, horrible sleep (waking up almost every hour throughout the night, and waking up much earlier than usual), and decreased appetite...all of which are bad signs - those issues are supposed to improve within the first 1-2 weeks, not get worse.  I wake up in the morning feeling a sense of dread, like I've been hit over the head by a 2 x 4. Nothing worse than waking up that way. I consider my social anxiety issue my most important issue, with depression as a close second, because if whichever med doesn't help my anxiety, everything else is mute...cuz the anxiety directly leads to the worsening of my depression. I'm thinking of trying Zoloft or Paxil next.",1,6,1

I started it this week (Feb 2019) and planning to stay at 10mg. I've tried Effexor and Wellbutrin, for reference.  Pros: • This drug has been great for anxiety, because it provides a calmness without knocking me out or making me not feel like myself. It works within a few days. Cons: • First round (2017), the gastro issues never really went away, though diminished to about 15% of the time.  • Cost without insurance. • Weight gain! This is why I went off it in 2017. I gained about 10lbs and my body fat percentage increased by 4%, even while I was in a workout plan with a trainer. That being said, this time I am also sticking to a cleaner diet with set calories that have allowed me to maintain my weight off the pill. I am hoping this baseline will give me better personal data as to if the weight gain is something I can circumvent.",9,9,1

I started taking Viibryd about four years ago, been very pleased. No sexual side effects, even as I increased dosage last year. The only part I find super tricky is it's half life. If I forget to take my dose the next morning I start getting an itchy face. Seriously itchy like allergies! As I have ADHD too this is very helpful but annoying. If I am without my pills and have to wait until later in the day to take them some of the worst anger feelings I've ever had come out. It's like the hulk! Itchy hulk!

"Vilazodone","AF100","August 14, 2017","-","I tried this medication between Cymbalta and Trintellix.  Cymbalta did not eliminate my anxiety and caused stomach issues for me. Viibryd's half life is short.  For whatever reason, I would have discontinuation effects late in the cycle.  Taking in half 2x/day helped, but seemed to weaken the effect of the drug. Bottom line for me was that while it worked at 40mg part of the day, the end of the day would be very difficult, with brain zaps and lethargy.  If you have this experience like I did you simply may metabolize the drug too fast to take advantage of it properly.  It is unfortunate because other effects of the drug -- digestive, libido, etc -- were quite good.",6,4,1

I had zero appetite and could not even think about eating a vegetable for all 14 days. I could only eat very bland foods in very tiny amounts. I have gastritis and this drug flared it so badly, I had to take Prilosec. If you have stomach/GI issues of any kind, I would not suggest this drug. I would also advise you check with your insurance on the cost. I was given a sample pack, then called my insurance and it was going to be $223/month for me.",1,5,2

The first couple of weeks that I was on this drug I had vivid dreams.  Some scary.  When I forgot to take my pill one morning, I felt very foggy all day at work, and then my face got super itchy.  I read that I shouldn't take it when I got home, but to wait until the next day, and take it the next morning, as usual.  BAD IDEA!!  I had horrible brain zaps!  Like someone put a live wire on my head.  When I finally fell asleep, I had the worst dream ever.  This dream woke me up and I was terrified.  I took the pill at midnight, ASAP, and it helped.  Within an hour I was asleep.  Not an experience I would ever want to go through again!!! So, I was on this drug for a few years, and while it really helped my social anxiety.  Never got a nervous stomach ache while on this pill - and I even started with a direct sales business and was actually teaching small classes at people's homes.  (That was unheard of for me!  I was the shyest kid in class back in my childhood days). I was feeling super confident, but started having gastric issues and gained 30 lbs.  I have always been very thin, so 30 lbs made me feel horrible about myself.  The drug inflamed my stomach and made me a sugar fiend.  Basically, I felt like a heroin addict - but with sugar/carbs.  I hated myself because I couldn't stop eating dessert!  The sugar made my depression worse, and super fatigued.  I didn't realize that any of this was caused by the drug, so I saw numerous doctors, had ultrasounds, GIs, colonoscopies, etc., and spent a ton of $$ on those doctor/lab bills.  I prayed and prayed, and saw that others had some similar reactions.  I weaned off the pill, and lost 21 lbs so far.  I feel pretty normal.  But I am still taking Bupropion for depression.

I personally had severe side effects including vertigo, and watery diarrhea. All the side effects passed after a couple of weeks and increasing the dosage had little effect on me.

I'm more outgoing, talkative and social (presumably because it addressed undiagnosed social anxiety too). Depressive, suicidal thoughts are gone too.  The only side effect has been frequent and occasionally loose bowel movements.",0,39,2
"Vilazodone","Anonymous","December 13, 2011","-","I had tried several different types of medicines and combinations of medicines for my anxiety and irritability.  Cymbalta has given me terrible side effects: sweating, constipation, hair loss, hypertension, dry mouth, and weight gain. My doctor thought that Viibryd might be a better option.  I was very apprehensive and I was ready to give up on medicines.  The ramping up with the Viibryd (10mg to 20mg to 40mg) was a horrible experience. I had terrible nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and spaciness.  I couldn't distinguish if it was withdrawal from the Cymbalta (if that was possible with the switch to Viibryd) or if it was the Viibryd....could have been both.  That all being said, now I'm on the 40mg and I feel great. I feel like the person I used to be.",8,27,2
"Vilazodone","Mickey 20","September 12, 2011","-","<b>Viibryd (vilazodone):</b>			 I just started taking Viibryd five days ago.  I switched from Zoloft to Viibryd.  I was having bad headaches and an overall feeling of yuck in the mornings.  I started feeling better at the end of the day when I was going to take my next dose of Zoloft.  I also could not sleep.  I would wake up at night and then couldn't go back to sleep.  Since taking the Viibryd, I have been able to go back to sleep when I woke up in the middle of the night.  I am a bit sleepy in the morning, but I am feeling a bit better.  I am hopeful about Viibryd.  I hope that my condition continues to improve and my sleeping patterns continue to get better as I increase the dosage and as time goes on. Zoloft did help, but the side effects were too much for me.",0,109,3

I  highly recommend this medicine.",0,243,3

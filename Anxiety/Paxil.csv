"Paxil","Anonymous","February 11, 2020","-","I was very skeptical about taking paxil as I’ve never taken a daily medication before. I started taking it and was on it for 4 days. On the fourth day I work up with this dizzy/ groggy feeling. I didn’t think much of it and then I took my medication for the day. I decided to take a nap due to the dizzy feeling and when I woke up I had the worst suicidal thoughts, my head felt even worse, my eyes couldn’t focus on anything, my pupils were dilated, my body felt extremely limp but I was shaking and I also had cold sweats. I called my doctor and she recommended I go to the hospital. I ended up not going because one of my friends had gone through the same thing and told me to stop taking the medication and just drink some water and eat some food. I felt better for the rest of the day but that night I only got 3 hours of sleep due to nightmares and suicidal thoughts.",3,13,1
"Paxil","Kjls","February 4, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I started Paxil over 15 years ago after an unexplained bout with extreme anxiety and depression that did not respond to hypnosis, yoga, nothing!!!   After trying a few other meds that didn't work, my dr suggested Paxil.  When I first started it I also took Klonopin for the horrible anxiety.   Within about 6 weeks I totally felt the dark cloud disappear so I went off Klonopin.  I have never had to increase my dose!!   I'm still on 10 mg, 15 years later.   I tried weaning off of it 3 times already and each time I would get really weepy and depressed, so I've decided to stay on it!!   Yes, I've gained weight but that is nothing in  comparison to how I was feeling prior to being on Paxil",9,37,1
"Paxil","Lemony","January 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My doctor prescribed me Paxil as she felt I had anxiety (and that I was depressed as a side effect). For what little anxiety I felt I had, it works great. I flew for the first time and felt no anxiety at all, I was like,  Wow, this is what it feels like to be normal.  However for depression, I still do get sad, although that may just be me (my therapy sessions are rather useless). At first when taking this I was on cloud 9. I was feeling great, and I had no appetite at all so I lost 8 pounds. Once I got used to eating without being hungry, my appetite got back to normal. I also started getting constipated while taking this, so my Dr. prescribed me Miralax. I also have noticed that it seems to have dulled my senses  down there , it takes longer to have an orgasm which is frustrating. I have heard about how this is a difficult drug to get off of, which I am nervous about. All in all I think it works okay but this is also the first anti-depression medicine I have ever taken.",7,23,1
"Paxil","bean","January 5, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Worst medication i have EVER been on in my entire life. Constantly tired, sleeping 16+ hours a day on short school mornings; cried when I had to work job at night due to exhaustion. Could physically not bring myself out of bed, worsened depressive episodes and dark thoughts. Depression went from a 5 to a 10 within a few weeks. I would genuinely not recommend this medication to anyone suffering from depression or any other ailments for that matter; I wouldn’t risk it even if the doctor was sure it was going to work. You might have a good reaction unlike me, but I would not wish the risk of feeling this way on anyone I know.",1,16,1

I went to the ER here in my country because I was convinced something was really wrong with me At the ER they checked my heart, my blood pressure and everything was fine.

"Paxil","Fredz","December 11, 2019","-","This drug works, but not without consequences. It took 17 years of my life. Taking this drug put you in the grey zone. It masks all your feelings, and all the side effects....  I also used 1,5 years tapering of this awful drug, every time I reduced my dosage, the withdrawal came. Now I'm older I know I will do anything to not be dependent on such drugs.",1,15,1
"Paxil","Shelby","November 14, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","HI, I have been on Aropax for 7 days now due to depression and anxiety. In the first few days of taking it I was incredibly shakey and when I spoke my voice sounded distant from my own like I was in a dream like state. I was yawning all the time. Although the symptoms seem to be getting better. I have restless legs, dry mouth, a stiff jaw and neck, I am cold all the time and my skin feels like it is itchy or crawling. I wish I did more research before taking it as I have just read how bad the withdrawal symptoms are.  Do you think if I stop taking them now only after 7 days it would be OK? Also I feel like I am gaining weight but eating a lot less due to no appetite and drinking lots more water due to dry mouth.  what to do?",4,22,1
"Paxil","Ken","November 5, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","After years and years of trying and failing with different medications, my doctor finally recommended paroxetine for my anxiety. No side effects unless I DON'T take it, no groggy feeling or haze over my memories anymore. I can function without feeling tired out half way through the day, I don't get dry mouth, I don't gain weight on this medication. All of which have been an issue with other meds in the past. Im very grateful to have found this.",8,42,1

This medication ramped my anxiety up bad . Thoughts way worse. I'm stopping after 6 days. I know there are those who say keep with it. I am getting 1 hour of sleep on this drug. I cant stay on it. It's not for me. I realize it may help people, but my comments are for those it didn't work for. You are not alone. I have insomnia, increased anxiety, I am a mess.",4,25,1
"Paxil","Hope989","September 26, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I took Paxil for 19 years and it relieved my anxiety and depression. I gained 40 lbs over those 19 years but I was happy. In May I decided to try Lexapro and sure enough I've lost 25 lbs. But at the expense of anxiety and depression returning. My Dr increased dosage from 10 -20 mg 5 weeks ago and now I can't sleep. I'm going back to Paxil, I'd rather be fat and happy, than skinny and depressed!!",9,73,1
"Paxil","erdem","September 24, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was diagnosed major depression and anxiety disorder 19 months ago. I first tried Lexapro 9 months and it worked for a while but then anxiety came back. Then I used Milnacipran for 7 months but the same story. I have been taking Cymbalta for 8 weeks already and my psychiatrist decided to add 20 mg Paxil. I am on the 4th day and today I experienced intense fear. No side effects so far, but I guess I am already suffering from Cymbalta side effects. I will write further reviews in the following days. I couldn't find any review mentioning Cymbalta and Paxil together, so I will share my experience.",5,10,1
"Paxil","tric13","August 22, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Before taking Paxil I was suffering from anxiety. Feeling like I was dying, hypochondria, heart felt like it was always beating out of my chest, sweaty hands, etc. Now that I’m in 20 mg a day for the last 5 months all of my anxiety symptoms are gone. The first month I had to trouble orgasming, but it’s resolved. I gained about 10 pounds but that’s better than my previous suffering",8,36,1
"Paxil","Nm","August 20, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on Prozac for many years. I felt that is was time for me to get back on it  due to increased stress and menopausal symptoms. I have been anxious and depressed. My dr recommend I try Paxil. It is an SSRI like Prozac but has additional properties that help with menopausal symptoms. I am only on 4 weeks but I am going to switch back to Prozac. I am taking 10mg Paxil and I am constantly tired. I feel out of it. It has helped with anxiety  and heart palpitations but instead of giving me a sense of  clarity  when I am annoyed or anxious I am overwhelmed with a sense of exhaustion...like a sedative feeling. Not much of an appetite either. Zero sex drive. I hope the Prozac will work again and it’s not that my body chemistry has changed.",3,15,1
"Paxil","GaryPeter","August 9, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Have been taking Paxil for 6 months for everything anxiety depression. Within these six months, I noted that I was feeling nothing. No highs or lows.  Yes, I could smile at good news but even the death of my mother, 2 weeks ago, in July, I had no reaction to, except, thank God her suffering is over as she was 92. I called the hospice literally 30 seconds after she was pronounced.  I felt little. My sister called me a minute later. She was hysterical and driving to get to the hospice. I just wanted to be with her on the phone to make sure she got there. I am a NYer living in Italy and now, I must wait for her ashes to arrive here. A lengthy process so I cannot consider beginning closure. I am not depressed, though relieved. I am not panicking. I am just feeling pain in my chest, so tight, that I cannot let out what I believe I would be feeling. I feel like a machine. My doctor told me a week after mom's death that a side effect of Paxil is the inability to cry. This is not normal. For me.",3,26,1

After about 2 months on Paxil, I got a sudden feeling that everything was going to be OK. This dread of the future and hating life went away. However, this did come with the side effects of gaining 15 pounds and losing most of my sex drive. I do still have depression during the hard times of the year but my anxiety is so low and I LOVE it.",8,39,1

"Paxil","melody23","May 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on Paxil for just over four weeks and its been amazing. I was anxious and stressed and had extreme anxiety about my health. I was desperate and even though I read the reviews - and worried about taking it - I decided to try. I can't begin to explain the calm that is now me.  Importantly, because I was so hyper sensitive the doctor asked me to start on a quarter tab and each week I went up - quarter, half, full tab. I think the full tab is 20mg. Remarkably I felt benefits straight away and each time I upped my dose I felt tired for a day or two and then normalised. I had some yawning, dry mouth and loss of appetite. I also sought psychology treatment and have been diagnosed with delay onset PTSD from past trauma.",9,44,1
"Paxil","Brainzap","May 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I have been on Paxil 20mg now for over a year and it seriously helped my anxiety during a very difficult period of my life. Now that  I want to come off the side effects are awful. I experience brain zaps with the lower dose or when I accidentally miss a dose. Which make me want to just go back to my regular dose because they are so uncomfortable. I am tired no matter how much sleep I get. My sex drive comes and goes, but can go longer amounts of time without even thinking about it. About 5 months ago I was experiencing brain fog where I was forgetting what I was talking about half way through a conversation.  All in all, there are pros and cons to the drug. It really does help but there are so many other things to consider. I really want off but I am so afraid to experience any withdrawal symptoms. Good luck to you all!",3,33,1

Not one adverse reaction in 30 years.  Then in November 2018 my pharmacy could no longer fill my prescription. I was told they no longer make paxil.  I started taking cymbalta instead but it did not work and I went into a deep depression, unable concentrate, hurt all over and suicidal.  Why did they stop making it?  My Dr. started me on Prozac 6 days ago and I am struggling to focus.  I cry all the time and can't think straight. I have feelings or worthlessness and don't care if I live or die.  Why did they stop making it.  (They stopped the Paxil brand but it is still available as a generic tablet called paroxetine)",0,26,1

The side effects for me have been weight gain (20lbs) and decreased ability to achieve orgasim.  I have recently cut down from 20mg to 10mg and while my anxieties have ramped up somewhat, it has brought my sex life back.  I feel 10mg is the right balance for me now.",8,26,2
"Paxil","Red","January 2, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I used Paxil for 7 years for anxiety and it works fine , it’s not that you don’t have any anxiety but it does diminish it . Last year I decided to quit because I thought I don’t need it anymore and started taking half dose ( 10 ) and then a quarter . Everything was fine till 15 days after I had quit totally . My anxiety came back and the negative thoughts were on the run . So I get back on it , 15 days now and am felling better .  It takes at least a month to fully work , but in the meantime anxiety is there . Only the people who suffer this can understand how overwhelming this constant fear can be . I think this will be forever or until something really awesome and new came to market . You can not live in fear .",0,57,2
"Paxil","Matt","January 2, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","10 years on paxil. If you have anxiety this drug should help. I had depression as well and think it helped there as well. I was on low dose of 15mg used with 50mg wellbutrin. These two drugs work great together. I've noticed periods where I think I feel to good. Now we are looking at potential of SSRI induced hypomania. This is fairly common and I only figured it out after reading a lot of info online. If you need to get off Paxil I recommend getting liquid version and titrating very slowly off it. Months not weeks. I'm currently down to 7mg and feel low most times. Trying Lamictal now and will wait and see how that does. Paxil also gave me issues with my sex life.",7,13,2

"Paxil","Vandad","November 30, 2018","-","I used Paxil for 13 months for general anxiety. My general doctor introduced paxil to me. I've started with 10mg and later increased it to 20mg.  It worked amazingly for that time. The only downside was I gained  13 pounds and lost my sex drive that made me want to quit. I knew that I shouldn't stop cold turkey , so I consulted with my doctor. This medicine withdrawal is the worst. Tapering off from 20mg to 10mg was nightmare: constant electric shocks, flu like pain in the whole body, nausea and vomiting . It took two weeks for me to adapt to the lower dose. Changing it to 10mg every other day was ok but again quitting it all for good was the worst torture . I tolerated the nausea and vomiting for 5 days in the row and I couldn't do it any more so I took the 10 dosage again. Doctors don't warn you about the withdrawal but please please if you are reading this , don't take start paxil.  Quitting it is the hardest thing that you can not even imagine.",3,25,2

I went on Paxil for almost two years and it helped me not only get back to myself but a better self. I never gained weight because I exercised few times a week and I never had the crazy side effects. If your thinking of going on Paxil I would highly suggest it. I also did not get the horrible side effects while weaning off. My anxiety was a little high but nothing crazy. I am hoping this helps someone out there because I understand the frustration of reading all of these horrible reviews for the mediation your trying to go on :-/ I did have a bad experience with a medication but I was only on it for two days and got off It right away.

"Paxil","LongTimeSufferer","August 9, 2018","-","Took 6 to 8 weeks for this to kick in fully. I suffered from severe generalized anxiety and agoraphobia. It was hard to do anything. I was in constant fear of my heart rate going high, not being able to get medical attention in certain situations and overall anxiety levels through the roof.  I've tried Citalopram (Celexa) 20, 40 and 60mg and didn't work, Effexor and didn't work, Buspar and didn't work. Xanax helps and Klonopin helps. Out of those two I prefer Klonopin but they aren't meant for long term and only used them when I was really desparate.  I've been on 20mg of Paroxetine (Paxil) for 4 months now and it's like I never had anxiety.  I'm able to go on trips planes, cab rides, busses. I'm able to go outside and enjoy myself. I started golfing again which I love. I'm able to go to the gym and exercise and not freak out that my heart rate is high and start having a panic attack.

"Paxil","Anonymous","August 9, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been on it since around 1999. I had been doped up before on Xanax and sick like a dog on Buspar. 2 weeks after taking  paxil I woke up from a 5 year bad dream. Here I am today almost two decades later. If it makes you feel sick after a month taking it then it's probably not right for your chemical imbalance. Buspar was that way for me. But if it's right for you you'll know it. Everything will feel normal again. No more excessive worry or constant fear of going crazy. I will say it's a commitment if it works on you. Getting off it sucks real bad but if you're like me you have no desire to go back to the nightmare. But if you don't like it just stop after a month to reduce withdraw risk. Just realize this is not a good drug to be on temporary, it's something you have to take to function until there's a cure. It's affordable without insurance too. I thank Paxil every day.",10,62,2

I think this is a helpful drug - it helped me reduce my anxiety in different social situations at work, and prevented me of finding other not so constructive and not so healthy solutions to reduce my fear.

No weight (sporty) but if I missed a dose after 1 year I started crying for no reason, my doc kept prescribing it and I thought I was OK.  Yet it totally numbed my true emotions and stole my conscisouness and nature. I was mostly in my head, seeking pleasures and not feeling the necessary fears (dangers) in life.  After 18 years it pooped-out and did not work at all. I was just tired and depressed. I had to wean off which was a nighmare (panic, brain zaps, pains, suicidal urges, pure hell).

Not ready to give up sex to possibly get over some anxiety and depression, but seriously if the side effects are this bad after 4 pills what would a month be like.  Then after stopping after 4 days it was like the whole process in reverse as I has gotten over the headaches and sickness after 2 days, it took another 2 days to get over it once stopping.

I have a much better time on P than on Z.  My only problem is the weight gain that comes with it. It's very sad for me to gain 20 pounds.  But still, it's better than being so scared all the time.

I didn't even realize I had so many symptoms of anxiety until I was on Paxil. I feel better than I have in two years. HOWEVER, there are sexual side effects (decreased sex drive and difficulty achieving erection and ejaculation). Since I'm a newly married man in my mid-twenties, these side effects are very frustrating. Other than that, this drug has been very effective in treating my anxiety.",8,56,9

"Paxil","Anonymous","July 14, 2009","-","I started taking paxil 13 years ago. I had severe panic attacks. It gave me my life back. Mild side effects. A little sleepy. I just hope it has no long term damage but at least I can enjoy my life.",8,51,9
"Paxil","Anonymous","July 14, 2009","-","Bipolar Disorder: This medicine has helped reduce my symptoms of anxiety, agitation, and impulsiveness.  But it does not help with depression symptoms in the long run.  It has caused my mood to go up and down, even though I'm using other medicines to stabilize my mood.",5,13,9
"Paxil","lizzylou","April 21, 2009","-","I have been on Paxil for 6 weeks now and it just finally kicked in. I suffered with anxiety and extreme panic for 6 years. Now I'm fine. I can't believe it. It's my wonder drug. My life feels normal now. However, I stopped taking it for three days in a row and I felt crazy, so do not cold turkey this drug.",8,109,9
"Paxil","Wooolstun","March 29, 2009","-","I started taking Paxil about 7 or 8 years ago for anxiety.  I had been in the hospital for an arrythmia at age 24 and it totally freaked me out.  After that, every illness I had I was sure it was my heart and I started to panic and check my pulse frequently. I ended up in the ER about twice a month thinking I was dying. My PCP finally suggested Paxil.  Since then I have had ZERO panic/anxiety attacks.  I have had problems occasionally with ejaculatory dysfunction, but not often enough for me to be that upset.  Besides, the trade-off is feeling better and living normally. It has been great for me and I hope you have a similar experience.",10,167,9

"Paxil","Anonymous","December 16, 2008","-","Have been taking it for approximately 10 years.  It is a miracle drug for me.  I suffer from Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder and panic attacks and believe me, it is no fun.  I nearly drove my family crazy.  I tried several other drugs before the doctor put me on Paxil and none of them worked for me.  I have taken 20 mg of Paxil per day since I started on it and within 6 weeks I was a different person.  I am told I will probably have to take it for the rest of my life (I am currently 57) but that doesn't matter to me.  What matters is that I can enjoy my life and my family again.",0,261,9
"Paxil","nygirl","September 15, 2008","-","For over a year I suffered from unbelievable anxiety. Something very new to me. I first thought it was because my son was in Iraq, and my Dad had died, but I soon thought there was more to my anxiety. My doctor prescribed Paxil and wow what a difference. This is a very good drug for anxiety.",10,199,9
"Paxil","Anonymous","August 27, 2008","-","Paxil changed my life so far. It's been 3 months on 10mg's and my anxiety is all but gone. Sometimes when I have PMS I still get some anxiety but I am not willing to take more than 10 mg's so I will live with that. If taken properly it is great.",9,101,9
"Paxil","Anonymous","July 23, 2008","-","I was given Paxil 3 years ago. I didn't know what a basket case I was until I started getting better. No side effects at all. I will encourage any one to at least try it for 6 weeks it is a great drug if you truly need it.",10,170,9

"Paxil","Anonymous","April 24, 2008","-","I have been taking Paxil for about 6 years now off and on.  After a while they stopped working, my doctor switched me to something else. Can't remember the name but that did no good for me. I stopped taking them and am going to the doctor to go back on Paxil. It's the best treatment I have had.  It kept me calm for years, it's great for this condition.",10,50,9
"Paxil","Anonymous","March 26, 2008","-","I have been taking Paxil for about 6 months.  Before that I was taking Zoloft for depression.  While I was no longer depressed feeling on Zoloft, I realized that was getting stressed out about little things. I have always been high strung and full of energy.  Since starting Paxil I have calmed down and I am able to relax. I have just started taking Niravam for high stress moments. I have gained weight and I am also tired feeling, but the peace of mind is worth it",10,78,9

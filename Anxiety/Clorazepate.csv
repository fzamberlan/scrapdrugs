"Clorazepate","Pipes","April 3, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Tranxene (clorazepate):</b>			 Have been taking tranxene now for about 3-4 weeks and it's worked great for my general anxiety but not for underlying anxiety. Still have panic attacks but this med still works great. I take 15 mg at night and it knocks me out",0,2,1
"Clorazepate","cl","March 25, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Why is this so uncommon now? This is by far the very best anxiety med I have ever taken. Yes at first it will make you feel like a zombie but I do not experience any side effects or withdrawals when I don’t take it. It’s not like klonipin that causes psychosis. Valium has an 8 day half life so you’re fine until day 9. This one is quick acting but also short lived, which is fine for PTSD. It works in @30 minutes and wears off in about 4 hours. I take 15 mg 3 times a day if needed. Valium is almost as effective but the others are not.  Makes PTSD anxiety manageable.",10,5,1
"Clorazepate","FurrFurrGurrl","March 12, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Tranxene (clorazepate):</b>			 I have been taking generic Tranxene since 2010. 7.5 mg up to 2x a day as needed. This medicine is a lifesaver. It stops panic attacks and, most importantly for me, it stops the ruminating thoughts in their tracks. This allows me to go about my day unimpeded by going over and over things that make me feel bad about myself. I've had no side effects from taking it.  I did have 1 perscription for Xanax in the mid '90s. It did nothing. No help what-so-ever.",0,5,1
"Clorazepate","Tomas","February 29, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Tranxene (clorazepate):</b>			 Tranzene A wonder drug for me, my anxiety got so severe that I couldn't eat, daily chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, fear and just a few to name. For me, tranxene is better than common benzodiazepine. A dose of a 5mg tablet does wonders. If I take in the morning, it lasts till late evening. So next pdoc appointment I'll ask for 2x5mg dose during the day. Recommend.",0,8,1

"Clorazepate","Benny","December 2, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","General Anxiety Disorder is a chronic disorder. The appropriate treatment for life is Tranxene.

"Clorazepate","Juju","July 10, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Four years ago I started clorazepate 3.75 at night to help with a burning tongue and panic attacks. My dr said the burning tongue was from an overactive nerve and allergies I didn’t know I had to mint. Within three months the burning was gone and I didn’t have any more panic attacks.  About three months ago my pharmacist started using a different manufacturer and at first I felt great... no problems. Then about a week ago (three months later) I started having very vivid dreams.  Nothing that would cause me harm... just nightmares or very realistic dreams which I didn’t have before. I’m wondering if it started due to change of manufacturing pharma? I still feel good , no panic attacks... but I don’t like that these dreams have started and I’m wondering if they will go away once I get use to these pills from this manufacturer or if I should try to find another pharmacy that carries the other manufacturer pill?",9,6,1
"Clorazepate","DeDe59","May 24, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Tranxene (clorazepate):</b>			 Back on Tranxene (I have anxiety) and it feels great. I am calmer and feel much better. I also started taking 20mg of Paxil  now I'm taking 30mg my the therapeutic is 60mg. So when I go back next month the dosage may go up again. Tranxene calms me down physically but not mentally. I hope keeps doing what it's suppose to.",0,8,1

"Clorazepate","Stressful job","April 24, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","It is better than nothing. But Xanax works much better. My previous dr in another city prescribed Xanax. I took it as needed for about 20 yrs. It kicked in almost immediately so I only took it when a bad situation occurred. I never became dependent or addicted. Current dr (different location) refuses to prescribe Xanax &amp; will only let me have Tranxene.   Since it doesn't kick in quickly I have to take it in anticipation of the occurrence of a bad situation. So I take it every day 1st thing when I get up so it will be in my system by the time I get to work. So I take more of it &amp; it works less well than Xanax. More drs need to know that Xanax is not really addictive &amp; it works far better than Tranxene.",3,16,1
"Clorazepate","SK_okay","March 26, 2017","-","I have tried various medications for anxiety/social phobia over the past 16 years. I have been prescribed several different antidepressants but none of them fix the anxiety. My doctor prescribed clorazepate 3.75 mg 1x a day (at bedtime) after my mother passed away and my anxiety got worse and I could not sleep at night. This medicine plus an antidepressant works so much better than an antidepressant alone. When I moved out of state my new Dr. wanted to take me off clorazepate because she said it is addictive. More Drs. need to realize this drug is a lifesaver for those who cannot tolerate valium, klonopin, etc. Clorazepate causes no side effects and I have never needed a higher dose in 8 years.",10,31,1

"Clorazepate","Ex-medic","December 6, 2016","-","I have been on traxene for about a year and a half. They started me on 7.5mg 2x a day. That helped but was not quite taking care of all of my symptoms. I was a paramedic in N.C. for 17 years and also worked at ground zero in 2001. Was diagnosed with PTSD. I asked my doctor if I could go on a higher dose so he moved me up to 15mg 2x a day and it has worked wonders. I feel like a normal person like I did when I was a child and did have to worry about everything. I am no longer a paramedic. Had to get out of that field because I do believe that is what caused my problems. But I live a happy healthy life now thanks so much to tranxene...",10,46,1

"Clorazepate","Jackie Blue","July 14, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I have taken TRanxene/Clorazepate since 1972, when my doctor had me try it after a suicide attempt due to severe anxiety and needing out of my marriage to a violent, threatening man.  It works in half an hour, and no side effects. Just lets you survive some terribly sad circumstances like friend being shot, worry about son serving overseas, behavior of bipolar second son, tornado hitting home, severe pain from two injuries to spine...you name it. I don't know why it isn't prescribed more. No headaches, no stomach cramps, no mania, etc. just lets you quit the tears and fears and get back to work. Especially love that you can just take as needed vs taking a pill that DOESNT help, 3x a day for all eternity.",0,55,1

Back then it was a new trendy medicine to help people with panic disorder. This has worked for me so I can live a normal life.. actually a MORE then Normal life! I had tried Xanax and many others with NO avail. This medicine has been extremely effective due to the long shelf life it works for me great! I was able to be a great mother, friend, and work my way up at work. I feel so many would benefit from this wonderful medicine as long as they take as Dr. orders it. Yes, over a time.. your body needs more of it. I have never experience any bad side effects from this medicine. I wish more Dr's were informed of this medicine truly being a medicine!

But, I felt I, either had been on it so long it lost some of it's effectiveness, or my anxiety and panic attacks got worse due to a tragedy. But I switched to Clorazepate and I cannot believe how much better I feel. I took it before, yrs ago, for a couple of months, and I do urge you not to start out on an extreme high dose, until you know how it works for you, and if you need to increase it, you can. A true lifesaver for me. Good luck to you others out there.",10,69,2

Due to high levels of stress associated with having 3 teenagers in the house, as well as one of them with behavioral problems and another with medical problems, my dose has to be upped.  It seems to have NO effect whatsoever once the anxiety hits high levels (and then take it).  If I take my dose of 15mg about 20 minutes BEFORE I know something will happen (such as leaving the house) my anxiety is much lower.",8,40,2
"Clorazepate","Beverly Anne","July 23, 2013","-","<b>Tranxene (clorazepate):</b>			 Traxene is one of the older medicines.  I like it much better than Klonopin.  I am on the second dose of 7.5.  I do not take it every day, only as needed.  It has no side effects like the newer medicines.  It relives anxiety in about one hour, not as fast as others, but longer acting. It even takes away my sadness, which is probably caused from anxiety.  I hope they never remove this medicine from the market.  It is a wonderful stabilizer.

"Clorazepate","Merkman","May 13, 2010","-","I have just been prescribed clorazapate after trying Zoloft for anxiety which did not help me at all for anxiety.  My doctor decided to put me on this after I told him that and it has seemed to control my anxiety and panic attacks to a certain extent.  I am glad that I finally found a medication that actually gives me a noticeable change rather than something you must take in order for it to build up in your system for its full effects.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is because it doesn't seem to completely eliminate my symptoms as I had hoped it would.  The medicine however does do a very good job controlling my symptoms to a point where I can live a normal life again as I had been doing prior to this onset of chronic anxiety.",9,55,2

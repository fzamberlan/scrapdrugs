"Lorazepam Intensol","zeusheider","May 27, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I have severe social anxiety, am uncomfortable with groups of people and was like this all through my high school and college years. It had a profound effect on what I was able to articulate in. During my annual physical in my middle twenties my PC picked up on the fact that I was depressed and sent me to a social worker. After several sessions I was referred to a psychiatrist and diagnosed with severe depression with anxiety disorder. He put me on many different anti depressants and anti anxiety medications until finally the combination of Cymbalta and Ativan finally started working for me. That was 6 years ago and I feel like a new person. I can get up in front of a group and speak! Something I would have died for I had to do before. All that time I thought something was terribly wrong with me.  Ativan saved my life.",10,33,1
"Lorazepam Intensol","Snowcaller","February 26, 2016","-","Avoid Benzos. I'm an alcoholic now, thanks to Lorazepam addiction. They leave a mark on you. Lorazepam was my vice. Again, avoid benzos. It can't end well. Benzos are a one way street.",10,28,1
"Lorazepam Intensol","Clyons","July 10, 2013","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been having anxiety since I was 7-8 years old! I used to take Paxil when I was about 18 years old and it helped except for the upset stomach part but then that went away (from Paxil) I was 1st prescribed lorazepam when I was I think 20, and have been taking it now for 12 years! Love it and only thing I find is I get a dry mouth every now and then but its not so horrible as some of the other ones I've taken. I'm just trying to find another medicine now that can stop the attacks.",10,52,1

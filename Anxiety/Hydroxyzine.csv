"Hydroxyzine","NatS","June 10, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","<b>Vistaril (hydroxyzine):</b>			 I’ve been taking Vistaril for anxiety on and off for years. More consistently for the past two years, it truly does help with anxiety, and is far safer than Benzo’s. I got hooked on benzos and had to withdrawal over a year- that was fun (insert sarcasm). The only negative I can list for Vistaril, is that the day after I take a Vistaril (I only take PRN) I’m in the worst mood. I even tell my husband, I had a vistaril yesterday, so leave me be. (32y/o female).  You’re not alone. :) God bless.",0,4,1

It didn't make me feel sleepy at all and it didn't help my anxiety, it made my anxiety a thousand times worse and I had a panic attack that lasted about 3 hours and I would not calm down.

I have tried all kinds of drugs and I also I tried CBTI and meditation.  I am 70 years old. Just  last week my sleep doctor finally prescribed this  hydroxyzine for me. I take 10 mg at bedtime – literally at bedtime, It works within 15 to 20 minutes.I cannot believe the difference it has made. I sleep through the night, prior to this if I slept at all I had at most six hours. I could easily sleep eight hours now. I wake up feeling very good. I’m taking nothing else with it. It’s not been quite a week yet, and I hope to continue this fabulous response. I had never heard of it before this, but I would suggest if you have problems with sleep and you might ask your doctors to let you try it.  From my reading there are no long-term side effects, and no withdrawal symptoms. It is so much better than taking diazepam or Ambien.",10,3,1

My job had me on 55 hours  week, for 8 months straight and I was constantly crying, dreaming about my job, and waking up out my sleep thinking about work! It has been awful. I literally checked myself into ER cause I didn't know what was wrong with me. I was put on some other medications but they put me in a zombie like state and I am a wife and mother so that was not going to work. So my doctor put me on this medication so I can stop my mind from racing and get some sleep.  Before that for 30 days straight I typically only had 2-3hours of sleep and now on prozac for the last 1.5 weeks I get 8-9 hours of sleep and I don't think about nothing - my mind is blank.

I have never in my sixty years on earth bought a drug from the streets.  However. The low dose prescription klonopin I took for many years with no issues.  The government has made it a hassle for doctors to prescribe benzos. They  will throw everything else at you despite side effects and lack of it actually working.  For persons with serious anxiety, buspar, visteral, lexapro do not work. I have tried them all. Benzos are a drug used in the treatment of anxiety for a decade and for most used safely.  It is  not the drug that is the problem they are safe and effective if used properly. As long as there are people wanting to abuse drugs there will be addiction problems.

It worked extremely well from the afternoon of the first day! Surprisingly, it calmed my constant anxiety and stress which I have had since being widowed a few years ago! When the prescription was finished and allergy was gone, I discussed it with my dr and he prescribed it as an anxiety suppressant that's refillable and I've been on it for a few months now, and am wishing I had the severe allergic reaction much earlier! What a difference to  my anxiety it doesn't interfere with mental thought process, just blunts the triggers of my anxiety. After my husband passed, my former dr had tried different depression meds (sample sizes), and all zombified me...I didn't want to be mentally blank, so after the 3rd med attempt, I told her to stop and I'd just get through.

For context, I am a male, 175 lbs, and deal with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Bipolar II I feel the drug hydroxyzine  is better as a maintenance drug  for anxiety then as an instant response to an acute anxiety/depression crisis. For me, the drug is much more mild than say a Clonazepam. It does alleviate anxiety, but still leaves with me a certain degree of control. Clonazepam and xanax can work great but also make me a slug and ineffective at work. Hydroxyzine provides me with more zen throughout the day without too much fogginess, but is by no means a cure-all for anxiety. Positive side effect: I struggle with my allergies and other physical responses (IBS) to anxiety. I have seen improvement in both. Helps me stay asleep at night.

Increasing the dosage just makes you more drowsy and the side effects worse.   If you can identify in advance circumstances that make your anxiety worse, taking a Vistaril before that can help alleviate things a bit.

"Cymbalta","Pstar89","June 3, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Ok I gave a review at 5-6 months being on Duloxetine now its been a year. I started out on 30mg's for a week then had moved up to 60mg's felt great for awhile. After about 5 months I noticed I started to feel anxious and just didn't feel right when up so we moved it up to 80mg's but pushed through 80mg's helped but still didn't feel right for a few months now I'm on 100mg's, I take  60mg's at 9am and 40mg's at 5pm and man do I feel great I finally am back - life has been amazing I know this medication isn't for everybody or people have had bad experiences on it but its truly helped me and I'm so thankful for that!!! Only rated it a 9 because nothing is perfect.",9,5,1
"Cymbalta","Jaciakky","March 13, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This drug Cymbalta certainly helped turn my life around. Starting on 30mg I moved up to 60mg after a week and stayed on that for a year or so. It completely cured my anxiety and helped me sleep.  Side effects were -difficult to hold on to pee, constipation and tiredness. Also bad night sweats.   This dose was great for my anxiety but it didn’t keep the migraines at bay so I was still getting flare ups about 3 times a week so was upped to 90mg but within 3 months I was back to 2/3 migraines a week. So up again to 120mg. On this dose I had no emotion; I couldn’t cry or feel sadness or happiness. I just felt numb and weary.  But no migraines! The side effects are too much so I’m back down to 90mg. Migraine is just under the surface and breaks through 1/2 times weekly. The plan is to reduce Duloxetine so my anxiety is under control and then add in another med to deal with the migraine. I would recommend this drug for anxiety but not quite so good for migraine so it was a compromise.",8,31,1
"Cymbalta","PennyQuick","March 11, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Taking Cymbalta is like having someone turn off the switch that controls my anxiety. It’s hard for me to comprehend how I lived with constant anxiety for most of my life now that is controlled. I will say this is a medicine that you must commit to taking as prescribed. Missing doses will bring the anxiety back full force.",10,25,1

They said another half an hour and I would’ve had a massive stroke I was 49 at the time, The doctor said it had damaged my brain and they don’t know how long it will take to come good if ever I felt alright after about a week never take this drug you can die from it",1,32,1
"Cymbalta","Chloe","March 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","NOTHING matters about this drug except the fact that withdrawal is horrific if you ever need to come off it.  Don’t start!  I am now in my 13th month coming off this drug. It has been the worst thing ever.  I am now counting beads in capsules and reducing slowly; am down to 10 mg. Five more months and I hope to get my life back.  This drug should be used only as a last resort when all else has failed.  Would give it a zero if I could.",1,30,1

The weather can be 50 degrees outside and I’m wearing shorts and a TShirt and sweating! My doctor has decided to increase the dosage to 90mgs and I must comply or else be considered a  difficult  patient.

Friends think I’m on drugs that are making me twitchy and nervous and that just adds to the anxiety. The one thing I specified to my doctor is that I don’t want to feel like I’m out of control and not myself!! I’m only taking 30mg. I’m weaning off ASAP. Thank goodness it’s only been a week.",1,41,1
"Cymbalta","Squazzin","December 15, 2019","-","This drug Cymbalta was absolutely, insanely brutal. Just terrible, I simply can not stress enough it was an absolute nightmare. I was prescribed this by my doctor for severe anxiety and depression, and I thought my anxiety was bad before, this made it much, MUCH worse. I holed myself up in my room shaking for the 3 days I took it, when before I had a tough time doing things, but I did what I had to do (go to work, appointments, etc.) This made me so paranoid I didn't even want to leave my bedroom, I thought there were creatures in my apartment that wanted to attack me I mean just absolutely ridiculous thoughts. I also felt immensely weak, my girlfriend came home one day and tried to get physical with me and her just laying on my arms hurt, and I'm very strong otherwise. I slept for probably about 68 of the 72 hours I took it. Didn't eat once. This drug is an absolute nightmare. First time I've ever taken an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication too. This has been a terrifying experience.",1,32,1

Didn't know if I could do it. Nausea. Couldn't stay awake. Diarrhea. I stuck with it. Week 2, symptoms started to fade. I'm on month 4, this is the best I've felt in so long! I'm not numb, I still get nervous, I'm still awkward, I'm still myself! But it doesn't control me! I'm in the moment now! I'm not faking It! The only side effect now that I currently have is occasional night sweats. Which I will take any day of the week over how I felt before! I've lost weight. I no longer have low blood sugar. I feel like my entire body makeup has been changed for the better! It's hard to explain. And I know some people may be skeptical. I'm 40 years old and this is the best I've felt in over 20 years.",9,87,1

"Cymbalta","SJ","November 11, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I had tried a lot of drugs for my horrible anxiety and depression. I've been taking 80mg of Cymbalta. Nothing before this touched my anxiety and I was housebound for 10 years.  The positives are my anxiety has gone from a 10 down to at least a 6/5 depression from a 10 down to a 7/6. I can orgasm - on other meds can cause issues The negatives - The withdrawal is REAL (try not to miss a dose),  constipation, my body metabolizes this medication fast. I have to take an extra 20 mg dose in the morning. When I was just on the 60 in the evening I'd get bad brain zaps/dizziness. The biggest downside to this med is getting off of it. If you need to come off it taper as slow as you can and ask to go on Prozac which can really help with withdrawal.  I recommend giving this med a try for anxiety. It's the only thing to help me. If you have depression alone I'd try something else first like Prozac or Wellbutrin as they are really easy to come off if they don't work for you.",8,41,1

"Cymbalta","Sky C.","October 20, 2019","-","Was given 30mg/day for GAD with chronic nerve pain &amp; insomnia.  It caused nausea immediately.  Dr said that should pass in 7-10 days. Around day 9 the nausea passed.  At this exact same time initial benefits I was starting to experience (lessened pain and improved sleep) returned to original baseline, and an itchy red facial rash developed on my cheeks. Day 18 dr said to stop the medication and that tapering was not necessary (or an option).  3rd day off the drug was incapacitated by severe dizziness &amp; headache.  This lasted 3 days.  I have heard that the research on the efficacy of duloxetine/how it really shouldn't still be on the market as EffexorXR and many other SNRIs / SSRIs have been repeatedly proven better than duloxetine.  Side note - my dr said that 13 in yrs prescribing duloxetine she's only had 2 cases of withdrawal that was problematic vs. 25% off all her patients on EffexorXR having protracted withdrawal problems.",2,18,1

After 3 weeks I felt like I was falling apart. Severe anxiety like never before. I thought I was having a heart attack! So much tightness and pain. Called 911.  Lots if tests later, it wasn't a heart attack at all. That was after 2 weeks on it. I was so deeply sad, severe nausea and vomiting, nightmares, sweats, biting down on my dentures constantly, itching all over. Dizziness, bad vision. My muscles ached. I've had serotonin syndrome before and this terrified me. I could not eat. I'm diabetic so I have to eat but food made me sick. Headaches, dark thoughts. Could not take it anymore and switched back to effexor 4 days ago, off the cymbalta. Today I feel great! I had a spell of nausea and overall feeling so awful, lasted 20 minutes or so. I also had pain in my right side and abdomen which is still tender but better. So glad to be feeling better",1,25,1

I was on lamictal for anxiety at the time, which kind of worked but not great. I took Cymbalta at 6:30 in the evening and within an hour I had severe diarrhea (which lasted almost two days). As I tried to go to sleep an anxiety attack set in, the likes of which I have never experienced before, and it swallowed me up. For the entire night, I was curled up on the floor under a sheet, shaking. My mind was trapped in pure fear and panic. I could barely walk to the bathroom, which, thanks to the gastrointestinal distress, I needed to do often. My mind was racing and voices were screaming in my head and there was no way to make it stop. It was absolute the worst thing ever. It started to fade around 6 or 7 am and by 4 pm I was feeling almost normal, just a little shaken up. I hope I never have to endure torture like that again.",1,40,1

I decided to give Cymbalta a try again (generic version). Initial side effects lasted a week. SO tired, brain fog, no appetite, headache. By day 7, all gone. I can't believe how fast it's working for me. My anxiety is gone. I am calm and easy going. I feel like the best version of myself. I'm laughing with my kids and husband and don't overreact.

I could not only tolerate it- it saved me. So, no- the medication shouldn’t be banned. It works wonders for some of us. If it didn’t work for you, accept it and try something else.

Had to reduce my citalopram before going on to duloxetine/cymbalta 30mg.  The Citalopram withdrawal was 20mg a day for 2 weeks then 20mg every second day then 2 days of nothing then start taking 30mg duloxetine every night. I have been on it now for 2 weeks and have noticed a little difference because it can take a few weeks for full effect to kick in. Withdrawal symptoms from citalopram were not nice at all. Maybe the reduction was too quick. I ended up in hospital for few days which did me good. I have been out of hospital for week but been on duloxetine 30mg for about 2 weeks so I know I have to wait a bit longer for full effect to take place.

The problem with Lexapro was that I didn't feel anything good or bad. I know that you might think that's a blessing, but it's truly not. After gaining over 20 pounds, my doctor suggested that I switch to Cymbalta, which I was very nervous about, but I knew something had to change.

I was diagnosed with autism, dyslexia and hyper-activity in the mid-1960's when research was still in its infancy. Anxiety was a continuous battle and after failing the 4th grade, all I remember was being in a fog. Cymbalta has cut through the anxiety even though the autism and dyslexia are hard-wired as part of my disorder.  I was recently pushed to 60 mg with improvement from my 30 mg dose.  As part of anxiety, you can feel the adrenaline flowing through you at the slightest distraction or obstacle, but Cymbalta has done miracles to cut the amount of adrenaline released.

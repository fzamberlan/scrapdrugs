"Oxcarbazepine","Caneman56","December 5, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Also helps with racing thoughts. I have 300 mg but have to break it in half. Stops insomnia!! I get a deep, deep sleep.",9,7,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Bebegurl","November 7, 2019","-","I have been on oxycarbazine for about a year now, I have to say it worked GREAT for my anxiety for the first 3 months.  It stabilized my mood, as in I didn't flip out on stupid, or small things. I didn't have anxiety at all, I got excited that I could go food shopping!! I know that sounds stupid but I've been battling severe depression and anxiety for over 4 years now. I had an accident almost 5 years ago and it left me crippled. Since then I have slowly gotten worse. I never had anxiety before in my life, never even understood",6,13,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Palante54","October 27, 2019","-","I have RRMS. In April I had another brain MRI. The results indicated a new brain lesion on my brain.  2 EEGs were also administered. My neurologist stated I was not experiencing vertigo, but possibly having seizures, convulsions or fainting spells.  I was placed on Oxcarbazepine, 300x 2 a day. I am now experiencing extreme anxiety. My neurologist first thought the anxiety stemmed from the steroids and it would go away. It hasn't and it has only gotten worst.  He now states it is my MS. I am using cannabis for the anxiety. Sometimes it helps and other times it does not. The neurologist prescribed low dosage (2mgs) of valium. I've taken it, on and off, yet sometimes it is not effective. I am concerned about addiction to Valium. I am forgetting things. I have tingling, numbness and feeling hot inside of my body. I went from being a very independent active person to doing very little. Is anyone else experiencing extreme anxiety due to Oxcarbazepine?",3,6,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Maddie","September 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve been on this medicine oxcarbazepine for about a month. Along with Busbar and Zoloft. I have noticed I haven’t been as depressed since starting this medicine but I still have my days. Honestly I don’t think it’s the right medicine for me though. I’ve had increased anxiety, restlessness at night, dizziness, anger, headaches, and somewhat feeling  out of my mind.  I was prescribed this for bipolar disorder which I still haven’t been fully diagnosed with.",4,4,1
"Oxcarbazepine","John Doe","August 21, 2019","-","I am also taking an SSRI, phenobarbital, Dilantin, and gabapentin.  A well-controlled epileptic who also has a history of depression and GAD. The polytherapy increases the odds of side effects from Trileptal, which may play into my case. Trileptal was started ~ 2 years ago and slowly titrated upwards up to 1,800 mg/day. The drug lessened my anxiety levels and symptoms, but I have experienced many of the side effects.  Hyponatremia, lethargy, slowing of my thought processes-particularly recall of facts, ataxia, and numbness of the fingers. I also experienced intermittent nystagmus. Currently at 1,200 mg/day, treating the low Na conservatively, and am considering lowering the dose further, but I also want to keep the anxiety in-check. It’s a difficult challenge. In summary, I am rating this medication as a five. It has worked or me, but I am not sure the side effects are worth it.  I do have a good psychiatrist and he has been aware and supportive of all of the adjustments.",5,1,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Sparhawk","April 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Only been on oxcarbazepine for a week, but from day one, my anxiety/panic attacks have gone away. I actually am starting to feel emotions, other than depression and anxiety. So far, for me, this is a wonder drug. Am on 150 mg nightly, will be increasing to 300 mg tomorrow. I am 50 y.o. , and have multiple allergies, so my psychiatrist is being careful.",9,20,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Friendly puppy","December 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Amazing effects on my borderline paranoid rage. Ask for a low dose if you're trying it! Doctors prescribe this at 600-1200 mg regularly, from what I understand, but my out-of-control rage is well-controlled on 300-450 mg daily and I don't get any of the crazy side effects people complain of. I don't understand why doctors are so eager to dump unnecessary amounts into people. What could be helpful becomes too difficult to deal with because of side effects. I've been on this medicine before and it works amazingly. I never should have gone off it, but I mistakenly thought I had better control now. This medicine changed my life.",0,26,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Anonymous","October 16, 2018","-","It works miracles for I feel a lot better I don't have anxiety or depression anymore",0,20,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Mag","May 21, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I don't like this medicine at all.  I was taken off depakote as it affected my liver.  And, was put on oxcarbazepine because of anger and aggression. I feel more anxious on this med, but I am numb.  I don't feel anything.  And, have been made stupid by it.  I cannot remember things and don't really care much.",0,14,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Anonymous","February 20, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I was having bad anxiety at night that would prevent any sleep. Some nights if lucky I'd only sleep 3 hours at most. So then my Dr told me to take this and instantly noticed a difference I'm actually able to sleep now!!!",8,24,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Vivica","August 30, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","18 year old Female- I have been taking oxcarbazepine (trileptal) for almost 3 years now ( for my PTSD), and while it does help manage my PTSD I experience some unsettling side effects daily such as nausea, fatigue , and recently I was diagnosed with chronic hyponatremia which my doctor has link to my oxcarbazepine because it lowers your serum sodium levels in your blood. Within the last 4 months  I have started having acute migraines if I take my trileptal even so little as ten minutes late. In my opinion the long term effects are not worth the decent level off PTSD management. My doctor is thinking of changing my mediation due to the negative effects on my health.",0,16,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Casslove","May 12, 2017","-","I told my doctor I have been allergic 2 like every single med I have ever been prescribed except benzos meds some sleeping meds. Lack of sleep can really imbalance the brain. Doctors have just thrown random diagnoses at me forever and I have almost died in the past from lots of them. My new doctor has tried me now on 2 antiseizure meds she says to fix anxiety - I had severe reactions to both. The first one, Lorazapam, I felt I was going to die of diarrhea  (it's a bipolar med) and I swear I felt bipolar for the first time in my life from it. This new one Oxcarbazepine made me feel just NUTS immediately. I was doing great with the benzos and sleeping meds then popped an Oxcarbazepine and feel disoriented super depressed like my mind is scramble restless",1,7,1
"Oxcarbazepine","happyme","March 19, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","My son's in his late teens and has anxiety and A.D.D.  He had also gone through episodes of depression.  Other prescription drugs left him zombie like.  Oxcarbazepine has been a miracle drug for him.  It took about 2 months to get to the right dosage.  Please keep in mind everyone is different.  He was only allowed to move dosage up once a week then every 3 days after a few weeks.  Yes he felt tired for 1-2 months but after a few months he says it's life changing and we haven't seen him this happy in years.  He's been taking it for  almost a year now with no problems. He takes 200mg caffeine for his ADD and it calms him down so he's doing great in college.",10,30,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Psych Undergrad","March 4, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My main issue was facing depression for years and took several antidepressants in the past. I don't have bipolar, but my psychiatrist decided to try a mood stabilizer for the first time since antidepressants weren't working and since I tried to commit suicide for the 2nd time a few months back.  Trileptal has completely took away my depression. Even when I hit a bump in the road, I'm not even close to the person I was a few months ago. I'm able to work 6 days a week, have more energy, and my thoughts of suicide are no longer present. Having a BA in psychology I want to add that meds are not a cure, but sometimes it is better than wanting to take your life and at least be an aid to help you get back on track.",10,33,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Anonymous","January 22, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I've only been taking it for four days now. I am concerned with how tired I feel after taking the medication. My doc prescribed me a 600mg dosage but had me break it in half for the first three days. I sometimes feel weak walking around for some reason. I will give it time to see if it improves my disorder. I can report that I have no appetite on this medication but then again I also take Adderall.",6,12,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Rhonda11","November 21, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Omg, where do I start! I have been dealing with acute alcohol withdrawal disorder and have had anxiety and depression for many years. The drs have tried to label me as bi polar, but  I don't think it's an accurate dx. Since taking this pill I have had vivid nightmares upon the first night taking it. I felt some relief initially and felt good for a week or so. I had my ups and downs. I took the pill without reading side affects, so that it would not affect my treatment.  I have had a constant sore throat, crusty sores on my nose that won't go away. I feel drunk when I take them. I don't get a full nights rest. I was recently dx with PTSD They doubled my dosage and  now I have agitation, restlessness, crying spells, depression and anxiety still.",1,16,1
"Oxcarbazepine","BeachFan43","July 4, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I suffer from Chronic  Depression and High Anxiety all my life. Other medications work but I am so out of touch with reality I choose not to take them.. I started a 300mg twice a day dose of Oxcarbazepine with 50mg of Pristiq. I have only been taking this for two weeks but so far everything is great... I am experiencing what its like to be  Normal ... A feeling I have rarely experienced so it feels a little abnormal. Life is much better now.... the best I have ever felt..  I hope it works for years to come",8,42,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Ronalda","January 21, 2016","-","I got put on this medicine because of my anger issues and anxiety. I'm on 300mg twice a day but it hasn't done anything for me so far. I've become very dizzy, I have double vision, fatigue, drowsiness, balance problems and speech problems, and I have almost passed out a few times.",1,13,1
"Oxcarbazepine","anes","July 14, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","Neurologist reduced medication from 250mg per day to 125mg daily. Reduction has increased headaches, anxiety, delusional and partial seizure. Sleeping patterns has changed.  Feel increased heart rate, cervical headache.",3,15,1
"Oxcarbazepine","jayndoe7","May 16, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","This medication is the first one I've ever taken that completely controls my extreme restlessness. I have tried antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and other anticonvulsants. None of them did the job. I tried this, expecting very little. I am amazed at how wonderfully this treats my issues. When I take it, it does take a while for it to take effect, but once it does, my restlessness and agitation completely vanishes. I love it because it doesn't make me feel any differently, I just suddenly notice that I'm sitting still and my mind is going a hundred miles an hour. Medications affect everyone differently, but this one works wonders for me!!",10,39,1
"Oxcarbazepine","Anonymous","February 6, 2013","-","This has been the most amazing medicine for major depression and chronic fatigue. It has literally changed my life. I have lived over twenty years with severe Major Depression and nothing has ever come close to giving me the quality of life that this has. A very long story short this medicine has helped myself, my son and my husband. I will never again go without it. I must stress that you have to take the time to figure out the dose that's right for you! I doesn't happen overnight. Good luck to all of you in your struggle.",10,82,1
"Oxcarbazepine","SantaFeJack","July 3, 2012","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Trileptal (oxcarbazepine):</b>			 I'm sixty-eight years old and have dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life.  There were some medicines over the years that helped, but for one reason or another, I had to stop taking them. But five years ago (July 17,2007) I had an acute neurological episode that awoke me from sleep straight into a Carnival Midway atmosphere. Very disturbing, and my sleep was never restful from that day forward. Four different polysomnograms verified I was getting less than a third of normal REM sleep.  Six months ago I discovered Ambien and was quite pleased, but I was recently to see a pain management doctor who understands the value of good sleep in dealing with chronic pain; his preference is Trileptal so I went on it. Never felt this relaxed and normal.",0,114,1

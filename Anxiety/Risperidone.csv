"Risperidone","Deb","March 22, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I am tapering off risperidone 1/2 mg per week I was on 2 mg to start with now I’m on 1 mg.  Tonight I felt like I was sliding across the bed. But I sleep with my dog and I wasn’t running into my dog and my dog isn’t being pushed off the bed so I know I cannot be moving. But I swear I was. I also have so much saliva that it’s giving me really bad heartburn. Help",5,5,1
"Risperidone","Jd","February 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Risperidone literally ruined my life before taking this drug I was outgoing and social but now I can't even talk to people or socialise it also makes me super depressed and anxious I wanna know if the side effects go away or is it permanent Ps:I wish I never took this drug",1,18,1
"Risperidone","Artazanasss","January 27, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","risperidone is pure poison almost single-handedly ruined my life it was prescribed for me for anxiety symptoms and I have used it for 3 years I gained 30 kgs.  I also have memory loss, involuntary arm movements, impotence and that's just starting it - DON'T use it under any circumstances.",1,9,1
"Risperidone","mark","December 23, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This drug should be the last choice, once you have tried all others. I don't recommend it. I was on 4 mgs at night and it made me sleep and eat better, but when you come off it its nightmare. I'm lucky if I sleep 4 hrs a night and the anxiety is worse than when I started. I was and am still on it now for 2 and a half years. I'm thankfully down to 1 mg at night. I can't wait to get off it. Slowly my sex drive and emotions are coming back. I don't feel like as much of a zombie. Also I have more energy.",1,13,1
"Risperidone","Anxiousannie","November 18, 2019","-","Risperidone is a miracle drug for me.  It has quite literally changed my life.   My anxiety followed me everywhere I went, all day, every day.  I felt like I had no control over myself or my life. I switched from abilify to risperidone about three months ago, and I'm like a new person. Night and day.  I went from constant paralyzing anxiety and weekly panic attacks to having only occasional anxiety, and at a much more manageable level when I do get it.  I actually can't believe how much better I feel.  I'm crying as I write this because I am just so happy to be feeling the way I'm feeling.  My thoughts no longer race, I can concentrate on one thing at a time, use logic to make calm and rational decisions, I'm no longer constantly nauseated, my compulsive behaviors have all but disappeared, and I have become a much happier and more open person.  I feel a million pounds lighter.  I am so grateful to risperidone for giving me my life back.",10,53,1

"Risperidone","Ginkgo Leaf","June 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was put on 2mg of risperidone as an adjunct to Mirtazapine for anxiety. I was incredibly reluctant to take it, it's an anti-psychotic after all, and I was terrified it would make me into a drooling zombie. For the first few days I felt awful. My anxiety turned into full-on paranoia and I could hardly think or speak clearly. Then suddenly I woke up and felt calm and collected. No more racing thoughts, no more battles inside my own head.  I'm so grateful for this medication. My only regret is that I took so long thinking I could cure myself with exercise, faddy diets and supplements. I should have gone on this a long time ago. To anyone who is worried about going on this - don't be. When it works, it works brilliantly.",10,53,1
"Risperidone","Khaleesi","June 10, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","For me, risperidone was horrible. It made me feel like my skin was crawling and gave me a horrible feeling I can't even describe. Taking this med was like drug-induced torture. I took it for severe panic attacks, depression, and autism spectrum disorder. It did not help at all. Luckily, my doctor found something (Remeron and Pristiq) that actually works.",1,22,1
"Risperidone","Crispy Packet","December 1, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","I am on fortnightly injections of 25 mg and it is hell. I feel this awful restlessness all the time and can't do anything with my life. It is AWFUL. All I do is lie on the couch and suffer. And I get this thing with my eyes. It is such an evil medication and I can't get away as I am forced on this medication.",1,16,1
"Risperidone","Lily","October 9, 2018","-","I was failed by mental health professionals by being prescribed with medications that debilitated me for years, this being one of them and I couldn’t do anything about it because I wanted to believe they were helping me. I became dependant on it and it made me delusional, fatigued, my ability to do anything became poor and my behaviour became strange and eccentric. I gained weight and I felt as if I had something wrong with me. It calmed my nerves but that was the dangerous part about taking this medication - I became mentally addicted to it and that’s why I never fought to come off it until I realised just how much it was ruining my life. Overall I have no words to describe the amount of damage this medication has done to me. I am no longer on this medication and I am so grateful that after almost a year I’m starting to feel better.  I do not recommend this medication at all, especially for anyone under the age of 18.",1,23,1

"Risperidone","spudpicker","February 12, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","This medication is terrible it made me so slow. I lost all of my friends and became agitated at even the slightest remark and anxious. It took me 7 years to complete a 4 year college course. I also lost all interest in girls and I felt like I suffered brain damage. Avoid at all costs",0,19,1
"Risperidone","Alex_32","February 6, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I was given risperidone after being admitted to the hospital last week because I couldn't take the anxiety anymore, even tho I was already on medication. I couldn't eat, had gag reflex's and unnatural thoughts. I had terrible morning anxiety and had to take lorazepam's. After one night in the hospital they gave me this drug and the next morning I woke up calmer and hungry.  They sent me home with a 0.5mg but the pharmacist made a mistake and gave me 0.25mg instead. So for the last week I have been still battling anxiety.  Last night I took the correct dose and today I was able to stay home by myself and not rush out to be around people, I ate more and got stuff done around the house. Today is my first day back at work. I look forward to better days as I continue on this drug that saved me.",10,30,1

"Risperidone","Anonymous","August 27, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I've always experienced generalized anxiety disorder but after 6 months of Ritalin for my ADHD the symptoms of anxiety worsened a lot, specifically evening/night, when ritalin starts wearing off. I was experiencing racing thoughts a lot and to leave the house to do something outdoor was struggle. My doc put me on Risperidone at 1mg day at night. I'm on it for almost 1 month now and it has been helping a lot. No more racing thoughts, a lot calmer, start sleeping more easily. The only side effects that I had were decreased sex drive and eating a lot at night (which actually is good for me because with Ritalin you are never hungry).  Would def recommend.",8,20,1

By 19, I switched to Invega and I got more anxious. Now, by 20, I returned to Risperdal (only 2mg) and I'm a lot better.

"Risperidone","Simonh2024","September 21, 2016","-","Had a severe nervous breakdown in 1998, I was a policeman and totally lost the plot. Whilst anti-depressants eventually took the depression away, I was left with chronic anxiety, so after therapy my doctor recommended this drug at 0.5 mg morning &amp; evening. Before my mind was racing, but this drug stopped me in my tracks, it wasn't a nice first two weeks, I felt like a zombie, but after this time I suddenly woke up one morning and the World was a beautiful place again. No more severe panic attacks, no more dreaded thoughts, just peace in my life. As I say, the first two weeks were unpleasant but so glad I stuck it out. A little weight gain, variable bowel movements, and one other thing, don't overdo it with alcohol, not nice.",10,73,2

This is a life saver. I only used it short term, 10 days, and would do it again. It has been 4 years since I took it and i still cannot believe what a life changing experience it was. It felt like my brain started thinking logically again.",10,61,2
"Risperidone","2 yr old Toddler","July 31, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","My daughter was given risperdone for anxiety and agitation she experiences with  medical procedures. I was a little reluctant to give it to her seeing as she is #1 A TODDLER #2 SEIZURE ACTIVITY #3 TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY in past medical history.  I was prescribed this medication by her Neurologist! I have never been so scared un my life...my child had severe visionary problems, nasal congestion and increased heart rate with the first dose. She seemed to literally go Blind! Please ask for alternative meds especially if your child is very young.  I am beyond livid and confused about why she was ever prescribed this medication in the first place. Please don't put another baby through this (or parent)...Just Don't",1,25,2

It only took one tablet and here I am 7 days later with severe dizziness confusion and sound sensitivity .  I had no idea this was a anti psycoctic . I only have anxiety and immediately was alarmed .

"Risperidone","Anonymous","May 1, 2016","-","My son just started on this med. for anxiety which is causing seizures or the feeling of a seizure coming on causes him to get anxious.  First dose at night 1 mg.  with in 30 min. he started to slur his words real bad.  He was in the hospital at the time so we pointed it out to them.  They just told us he had to get use to the risperidone. So he went to sleep.  The next morning he was give .5. He became very restless we thought it was from being in the hospital for 4 days.  He kept pacing back and forth fidgeting with stuff for hours.  Then all of a sudden he started slurring his words and became hard to understand. He told me his tongue was rolling up, and gagging, then his eyes started rolling up. Had to get emergency meds.",1,29,2
"Risperidone","jonnyturak","April 9, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Been on 2mg once a day for just over 4 months. Mostly wiped out my anxiety and panic attacks, but does nothing for my waves of agitation and irritability. I was reluctant to try it because of the weight gain. Now I regret it, as I have gained 50 pounds!!! I am the heaviest I've ever been and hate it. My pdoc wanted to raise it at last appointment, or try me on another antipsychotic (I didn't realise how heavier I was at that point). I'm gonna choose the latter option when I next see her. The weight gain on this is worse than quetiapine (which I also came off for the same reason).",5,18,2

"Risperidone","Carmen A","August 27, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Panic disorder took over my life. I had racing thoughts that would keep me up at night, nocturnal panic attacks, derealization and depersonalization, auditory hallucinations, and occasional paranoia. My doc first tried a beta-blocker, then an SSRI, both which did nothing to help me, before starting me on 0.25 mg risperidone. After about two weeks I started to feel a lot calmer. Instead of fearful thoughts sticking with me, they'd just fly out of my mind. After 3 months panic-free, I stopped the med due to side effects of forgetfulness, apathy, and weight gain. My forgetfulness got pretty severe by the end, but it really helped me snap out of the vicious cycle of panic disorder, and I'd take it again short-term if I needed to.",8,53,2
"Risperidone","jermo102","March 9, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I have been on Risperidone, 3 mg's every night, before bedtime, for 8 years. It worked better in the beginning, when I 1st began, with the name brand. However, it still works very well. I have to take it once a day, right before I hop into bed, or else I get Akathisia(Severe inner restlessness, and inner torture). That is the one and only thing I hate about antipsychotics. That and weight gain. All in all, takes away racing, disorganized thoughts, and calms the mind. Works to help emotions too. Good for anxiety. But don't go overboard with the dose. 9/10!",9,68,2

After only a few days I felt like such a new person!  Oh how I miss that feeling, it breaks my heart not to have that back again. I quit after only 3 weeks because I had read that Risperdal can cause seizures and already being at risk for them and having a lowered threshold towards them I just could not get that out of my head and relax with this medicine.

"Nefazodone","Mark","September 5, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I had debilitating anxiety and was prescribed Nefazodone.  I have experienced no side affects as far as I can tell and almost perfect relief.  I'm back to normal.  I only need 100 mg a day.  When I'm very stressed I sometimes have to take another 50 mg.",10,4,1
"Nefazodone","Redbird1","December 24, 2018","-","I have depression and OCD. Nefazodone (Serzone) changed my life. The chains of OCD and depression fell off within 2 months of starting this medicine. This medication was an answer to prayer. I have been off and on SSRIs but they did not help much. Paxil was the only medication that helped my OCD but the side effects were bad. I have not experienced any sexual side effects, weight gain, or fatigue with Nefazodone. Its been a wonder drug for me.",10,9,1
"Nefazodone","Dave","April 4, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been on this medication for 18 years, and thankful that I found it.  It was the only medication I found that would reduce job related stress/anxiety enough to let me sleep decently and not affect sexual function.  The only reason I rated this a 7 instead of 10 is because I have developed some tolerance to it (I am at max dose of 600mg).  I have had to also take large doses of SAM-E as well, but it does still work.  It is still available from at least 1 pharmaceutical company.",7,9,1
"Nefazodone","Aime_Joseph","August 2, 2017","-","This drug changed my whole life.  Suffering from anxiety depression, it did not feel or look like depression; nevertheless it was.  Mostly this expressed in anxiety, especially new events or chores, not to mention jobs or large changes. Within 4 weeks, the Psychiatrist asked me if it was helping; I wasn't sure, but, within 8, I told him, I feel like...me! That was 20 YEARS ago.  It still works and, no, that is not an illusion.  I have tried to gently go off several times under doctor's care, and always return to my unsettled state of fear. I have had a successful career and personal life, am healthy and content.  Nefazodone save me.",0,23,1
"Nefazodone","Reserve123","May 27, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I took my first dose of Nefazodone this morning at about 10:30 for anxiety, I went about it with being hopeful because I read all the positive things about this drug on this website, And I have to say it is not worth it.  I got 60 pills yesterday and  though I would take as prescribe by my physician 100 mg. twice a day. I would NEVER take this medication again, it is probably just me but within an hour after taking it, I got weak in my legs and arms, my head started feeling weird, I felt anxious, more than I did before I took this medication.  It may just be me but I won't take another dose of this, I take Doxepin 25 mg twice a day and I thought I would get something better that wasn't a WAIT GAIN medication, but I would rather carry the we",1,6,1
"Nefazodone","Burak","August 20, 2015","-","I have tried everything for my OCD. Nefazadone is the best one so far. It is an awesome medication for Intrusive thoughts.",10,29,1
"Nefazodone","Anonymous","December 9, 2012","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been taking this medicine since I stopped drinking - 12 years ago!  It was the ONLY medicine that ever worked for my panic attacks and depression.  I had no idea at the time that they were related.  I had been an alcoholic for about 15 years, and had almost given up.  A lady at work told me about it - totally by chance, and so I tried it.  It worked so well after a few weeks I was able to get outside and function again, and I was able to get off the alcohol.  I take it only in the morning and just after eating around lunchtime.  If I take it too late in the day, it keeps me awake half the night.  My speech has become a little hesitant over the last few years - a rare side effect.  But it's manageable and worth the trade-off.",9,28,1
"Nefazodone","harpinred","March 26, 2011","-","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 I have been using Serzone and the generic versions for over 15 years now.  When the brand was pulled from the market, I tried Wellbutron, Celexa and Prozac.  All three had horrible side effects and I finally found a doctor who would prescribe me the generic of Serzone again.  This medication keeps me on an even keel, keeps the anxious thoughts from overwhelming me and helps me sleep at night.  My liver panels are always perfect and my only side effect is that I have to take it right before I go to bed as it makes me sleepy.",0,71,1

"Tranxene","Pipes","April 3, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Have been taking tranxene now for about 3-4 weeks and it's worked great for my general anxiety but not for underlying anxiety. Still have panic attacks but this med still works great. I take 15 mg at night and it knocks me out",10,2,1
"Tranxene","FurrFurrGurrl","March 12, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been taking generic Tranxene since 2010. 7.5 mg up to 2x a day as needed. This medicine is a lifesaver. It stops panic attacks and, most importantly for me, it stops the ruminating thoughts in their tracks. This allows me to go about my day unimpeded by going over and over things that make me feel bad about myself. I've had no side effects from taking it.  I did have 1 perscription for Xanax in the mid '90s. It did nothing. No help what-so-ever.",10,5,1
"Tranxene","Tomas","February 29, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Tranzene A wonder drug for me, my anxiety got so severe that I couldn't eat, daily chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, fear and just a few to name. For me, tranxene is better than common benzodiazepine. A dose of a 5mg tablet does wonders. If I take in the morning, it lasts till late evening. So next pdoc appointment I'll ask for 2x5mg dose during the day. Recommend.",10,8,1
"Tranxene","DeDe59","May 24, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Back on Tranxene (I have anxiety) and it feels great. I am calmer and feel much better. I also started taking 20mg of Paxil  now I'm taking 30mg my the therapeutic is 60mg. So when I go back next month the dosage may go up again. Tranxene calms me down physically but not mentally. I hope keeps doing what it's suppose to.",0,8,1
"Tranxene","ogemaw","May 12, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I have had a prescription for tranzene [3.75 mg] for 40 years and it works for anxiety tremendously. Earlier in my life, it also helped with panic attacks and anxiety. At this point in my life, I use it to help with sleep. I take 1/2 tab. with 1 Tylenol and it's ZZZZ time",10,12,1
"Tranxene","Paintrmann","June 23, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","This generic drug has had a drastic jump in price in the last few years, I would like to know why.",0,18,1
"Tranxene","Crispy 38","November 4, 2016","-","I took it for a month to come off my valium it was great  no longer on any benzos Its great",10,21,1
"Tranxene","liccione","November 30, 2015","-","15 mg as needed no more than 2 times a day was absolutely the right dosage for me.  Side effects NONE.  Very effective for panic attacks and general anxiety.  I have tried most benzos, this is by far the best.",10,72,1
"Tranxene","Holly25372537","September 10, 2014","-","I have been on this medicine over thirty yrs. Back then it was a new trendy medicine to help people with panic disorder. This has worked for me so I can live a normal life.. actually a MORE then Normal life! I had tried Xanax and many others with NO avail. This medicine has been extremely effective due to the long shelf life it works for me great! I was able to be a great mother, friend, and work my way up at work. I feel so many would benefit from this wonderful medicine as long as they take as Dr. orders it. Yes, over a time.. your body needs more of it. I have never experience any bad side effects from this medicine. I wish more Dr's were informed of this medicine truly being a medicine! Please docs, help your patients!",10,148,1
"Tranxene","Anonymous","June 28, 2014","Taken for 10 years or more","I've taken this for years (3.75mg.) only as needed and it has always worked well and never given me that high feeling. It just brings me back to being myself.",9,95,1
"Tranxene","LMK1910","January 2, 2014","-","I was on several different more common anxiety medicines and they would wear off to quickly. Tranxene seams to be more stable and consistent levels in my body. Very helpful.",8,79,1
"Tranxene","Beverly Anne","July 23, 2013","-","Traxene is one of the older medicines.  I like it much better than Klonopin.  I am on the second dose of 7.5.  I do not take it every day, only as needed.  It has no side effects like the newer medicines.  It relives anxiety in about one hour, not as fast as others, but longer acting. It even takes away my sadness, which is probably caused from anxiety.  I hope they never remove this medicine from the market.  It is a wonderful stabilizer.  Hope this helps others who read this.",10,157,1
"Tranxene","Daveguess","January 13, 2012","-","Worked well for my panic attacks, not as fast as Xanax but worked!",9,65,1

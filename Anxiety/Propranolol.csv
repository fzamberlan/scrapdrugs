"Propranolol","Dani","May 25, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was prescribed 10 mg propranolol when required but I take it every morning because it lasts all day and I can actually socialize without anxiety for the first time in years. I’m amazed. I am able to be relaxed. No more racing heart, no shaking, no stuttering, no sweating, and I can look people in the eyes. I can just be chill. I am so grateful. I haven’t noticed any side effects. I have been on it for a week.",10,29,1
"Propranolol","John","May 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This propranolol has been a life-saver for me.  I have a thyroid condition which triggers anxiety, because my heart is always racing, even when I’m not nervous, and this caused me to basically have anxiety from knowing that I sound nervous all the time — even though I’m really not.  Since taking a small dose, my heart beats normally, and the world has gone back to a regular pace.  Really good stuff.",10,17,1

"Propranolol","Jojo","February 28, 2020","-","I've been taking propanolol for a week. Dr prescribed 10mg per day but I only take 5mg. It has been stressful past months that cause bad anxiety. So Dr recommended to take 5mg if I didn't want to take 10mg is what am doing. It helped lower bp &amp; heart rate due to anxiety for sure. My concern was I didn't take for a day bcuz my bp was normal and I felt good the whole day the next day at 530am woke up with fast heart beat, my left arm went cold and my wrist hurt a bit too, I panic because it felt like what a heart attack symptom sounds like but I don't know if was due to not taking the medicine for a day or it was just anxiety while sleeping which I haven't experienced the arm feeling before. I took 5mg it help me calm down but my arm still feels cold. I'll talk to my dr about it and see what is suggested for me to do or maybe ask to see a cardiologist because that feeling in my arm scared me bad. Side effects for propranolol are minimum like dizziness &amp; diarrhea right after taking it.",8,12,1
"Propranolol","Catty","February 25, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I take 30mg dose propranolol before I go to my university to help my social anxiety that give me heart palpitations and chest pains. This medication has done nothing for the mental aspects of my anxiety, but it has stopped my physiological symptoms caused by it. After about 5 hours I have to take another one. My psych says I should take one if I feel I'm about to have a panic attack, but it hasn't worked for me to help control them.",9,10,1

I take 40mg 3 times a day it helps my anxiety no end before I wasn't on this medication I would get severe anxiety attacks to the point where I was experiencing physical symptoms such as heart palpitations and chest pain and a racing heart rate which was scary due to anxiety.  Ever ever since I have taken this medication I feel more calmer and spaced out I do get 1 side effect though and that is tiredness but that is normal I can live with that side effect I am so pleased with this medication would highly recommend if you have anxiety. And stage fright",10,33,1
"Propranolol","Jarbles","February 3, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This was added to my Adderall XR doses. I am not sure it works but these two have been hand in hand for years now.  I know others who taken it for speeches and have felt no anxiety. I guess I am less angry all the time.  I am now taking bipolar meds and I guess it’s supposed to help with certain side effects of those, so kudos I guess.  I’ll say the only side effect I noticed was an initial over heating and sweating when I first started but that went away pretty quick.",7,12,1
"Propranolol","Janbee","February 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’m a female, 23, 125 lbs, taking propranolol 10mg for anxiety. This medication has worked really well for treating my fast heart rate when I get anxiety (120-145 bpm). I was very hesitant at first to take this as I was nervous for the side effects (darn you anxiety!) but I did not get any side effects! I have found that it’s better to take this before you know you’re going into a situation that will make you nervous. However, if you take it in the morning it will help all day. I have taken two 10mg while having a panic attack and it did work within 5-10 minutes. I definitely think this med is a short term solution for anxiety but I will continue taking as it has saved me so many times.",10,42,1
"Propranolol","Benzene","January 30, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Been on it for about a week and I love it.

No elevated heart rate from a stressful situation, no increase in blood to brain, no anxiety! I stay completely grounded and in the moment. Plus, so far no side effects. It's a god send!

Now I take it and I feel worse excess sweating and  nonsensical thoughts to whip up my anxiety. Ia m at a loss the doctor said increase it, and my thoughts are where does it end! I personally think I am going to decrease it by biting half the tablet and try something else. It is dreadful. I really do feel for you people suffering from anxiety, there is no easy fix, I tend to use alcohol which works, but short lived and comes with its own payoff. Ia m stuck. Any advice would be appreciated thanks.",3,24,1
"Propranolol","Chezzers","January 9, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have had symptoms or anxiety from a small age that has just progressed into adolescence where it morphed into panic attacks and physical illness due to stressful or anxious situations. As an active teenager I take part in a lot of social and competitive situations such as sports and leadership roles in cadets. The physical manifestation of anxiety, cold sweats, shaking, sickness, lightheadedness, tiredness, chest pain etc is painful and stressful especially since I manage it mentally very well and can't seem to stop my body's automated response. I was prescribed 60mg of propranolol which has absolutely NO effect. I get side effects such as cold hands and feet, and fatigue. Other than that all anxiety symptoms continue to persist. I have been taking the medication for over half a year and it has been no different in that time.  However everyone is different and my cousin had a very bad reaction on 10mg which made her very ill. So I can't say much for it. Sorry.",2,10,1
"Propranolol","Anonymous","January 8, 2020","-","I just started taking Propranolol 20 mg three times a day for fast heart rate due to anxiety. Day one I took 2 pills and felt a little dizzy and had diarrhea. Day 2 I took one pill in the morning and felt the same way and it gave me diarrhea. Day 3  I decided to stop the propranolol and didn’t take any more.This medicine has some serious side effects. Right, now I’m feeling so dizzy and maybe its a withdraw I’m not sure, but there’s no way I’ll take anymore.  I check my blood pressure it was a little low so I ate a can of soup to bring it back up some hoping it would stop some of the dizziness but that wasn’t the case. The reviews say it takes about two days to clear your system but the side effects can last up to one week. Today, is the first day without it, and these side effects are no joke. Not to mention my head feels so heavy and burning feeling and my eyesight is blurry. Be cautious and do your research before taking this medicine.  I don’t recommend it.",1,22,1
"Propranolol","Alphabravo33","December 31, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This drug propranolol works well for anxiety on a low dose of 10mg twice a day for me.  However at a higher dose of 20 mgs twice a day, it was horrible!  I had every side affect in the book at that dosage.    The dosage makes a big difference.  My wife takes 40 mg twice a day for migraines and has zero side effects.  I guess we are all different.  These reviews would be a lot more helpful if reviewers listed their dosage and how many times per day they take the medication. Someone taking 160 mgs a day could have a much different experience than someone taking 20 mgs a day.  More detailed reviews would help!",10,85,1
"Propranolol","Nat","December 28, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My life for the past few months has been a series of catastrophes, and therefore my anxiety has started presenting in physical symptoms. My doctor prescribed propranolol to me after I discussed having heart palpitations and tingling in my face (I also had a panic attack in his office... but that's neither hear nor there). He told me that this is a medication I can take when necessary. I normally take it when symptoms of anxiety arise, and I find it helps to reduce them. It works best as a preventative measure, however. For example, if I am going into a situation that I know causes anxiety (like going to see a doctor), I take one an hour before and don't face my regular symptoms. I find this medication helpful, but I don't think it's a complete answer to my problems. I may need to look at more long term options in the future, but this medication has helped me get through an intensely difficult time. I have not had any negative side effects when taking this medication.",8,28,1

However it keeps me up at night and causes my chest to feel tight with shortness of breath, very bad dreams and pounding heart which makes me panic. Not good! I also had all the general side effects including feeling very woozy and faint. These have since pretty much stopped so am hoping the night time stuff will too. I'm giving it 1 more month .",5,17,1

"Propranolol","Bill","December 15, 2019","-","I hate presenting and my voice cracks and my heart beats very quickly while doing so. With this drug  propranolol I still feel nervous but the symptoms of nervousness aren’t there (no fast heart beat, no voice cracking, no body shaking, etc.). I do notice though I sweat like crazy when I take this but my thinking is more smooth and not all over the place. For example I feel I think more clearly under pressure with this. I also get upset stomach after taking this. Overall propranolol is very good.",9,20,1
"Propranolol","Msm1993","December 11, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been taking this drug for 6 days now, 10mg twice a day.  Today is the last day I will be taking it.  It was prescribed by my psychiatrist for my anxiety and panic attacks, to help ease the physical symptoms.  When we discussed it, it sounded great, but unfortunately I don’t feel that it’s helping me.  Since I’ve been taking it I feel worse than I have in almost 2 years.  Dizziness, weakness, no appetite, trouble sleeping, no sex drive, and my anxiety feels higher than before I started taking it.  I’m not sure it’s helped the physical symptoms at all, since I’ve had multiple panic attacks since I’ve been taking it.  I also felt extremely depressed for a few days shortly after I started taking Propranolol.  I talked with my psychiatrist and was advised it would be safe to stop taking it, thank god because I feel awful.  I’m sure it does wonders for some people, but not for me.",2,28,1

"Propranolol","Alex","November 28, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This med puts a stop to pretty much all of the physical symptoms of my anxiety. I struggle in pretty much all social situations that I deem as a performance - that would be anything from ordering a pizza over the phone or buying a bus ticket to presenting to a class of 100 students. I generally get a very high heart rate and my voice begins to quiver and sound weak, I'll sweat loads and have all the other usual symptoms of anxiety. I've found Propranolol completely erases these effects. Fantastic!  One thing I would mention is that you will still feel the mental effects of anxiety, e.g. worrying and fretting before the event that makes you nervous, but having these in your system can assure you that these won't manifest in to physical symptoms.",9,39,1

"Propranolol","Mark","November 26, 2019","-","About three months ago my doctor determined I had Bipolar type 2 and prescribed a medication (Vraylar, 3mg) that is also really helping me with the highs and lows of the disorder.  After about 3 weeks of taking this med, my levels of anxiety jumped and I became very restless to the point I was pacing the floor.  I talked with my doctor about it and he prescribed 80mg of Propranolol.  Within an hour the restlessness and anxiety were gone and have been gone over the course of this past week.  Even the free-floating anxiety from my Generalized Anxiety Disorder has been reduced from an 8 or 9 to about a 2 or 3 -- without any nasty side-effects (at least so far).

Now I also get migraines caused by stress/anxiety. Propranolol has helped me manage my panic attacks/migraines. I take one a day to help prevent them. Obviously, I still have to go to therapy to help out with stress/anxiety, but this helps tremendously. It doesn't make me tired, but it's like a wave of calm. It works immediately.

"Propranolol","Lookforsomethingelse","November 20, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My doc put me on Propranolol at a small dose 2.5mg for situational anxiety. The main plus with this med is it is the only one that is not addictive.  It does however play up with your heart rhythm, slows you right down, and makes you sweat a lot. It makes you incredibly dizzy too. I would not recommend taking Propranolol in hot weather, because it will raise your heart rate and sweating. The only thing that made me cease this medication quickly was that I am asthmatic. I would NOT recommend Propranolol if you are an asthmatic. It is contraindicated in asthma so you should not be prescribed propranolol as it WILL make your asthma worse!! It would feel like a hand was grabbing at my throat every night, and it took 3 weeks to withdraw from this med from 6 days use. Not for everyone, but it is the safest anti-anxiety med. Better than Valium.",4,8,2

Other symptoms are involuntary spasms in my face, shaky hands and voice, dry mouth, red face and brain feeling clogged. I took 10 mg reluctantly because I thought it wouldn't help just before a meeting but I was sailing through with confidence, greeting people, looking people in the eyes when I talked to them and I was composed. The meeting, which usually feel very long, was a breeze and I got all my points across. I had gotten so bad I was waiting for when the adrenaline rush would take over my body with the inevitable fast heart beat, but it never came.  My heart stayed at a normal rate and with the symptoms gone I could focus on my work. This medication is good for people with performance anxiety and relieving physical symptoms only.",10,34,2

To be frank all that helps is Nurofen Plus or equivalent, but a)  Because of the scaremongering over opioids, maybe not as bad here in UK as in US, but there, pharmacists treat you like a drug addict and even refuse them! b)  I only work part time and can't afford £8.00 a packet plus petrol/bus fares to get to different pharmacies.

I am commenting here as I do have concerns on the side effects that I see directly and others comment on.  Firstly as often mentioned the heart slowing is an issue as I also do team sports and have had times where (as I don't like others to know I take this) I have later on in the same day had intense exercise, which has made me feel very poorly.  Even basic exercise is noticeable.  I also noticed that I can get extremely negative thoughts the following day and may sleep poorly due to this, which I find quite distressing and others notice this too of me.  I wish there was a way to flush this out of my system the moment I have been on stage, or at least get it out the way more quickly.

I FINALLY stumbled upon a forum about propranolol for anxiety &amp; blushing.  I would try anything at this point, and so thankful I did.  It is literally the only thing that has EVER worked for me.  40mg propranolol immediate release tablets 2x per day (AM &amp; PM) and I am a new person, there is occasional blushing and it's not an 100% cure-all, but NOTHING like the bright red tomato/hive look that I used to have when anxious. it has been a life-changer for me, especially since my job requires public speaking.  I've gained about 5 pounds, and also have to sometimes monitor my heart rate to make sure it's not too low, which isn't ideal, but I will take that over the awful circumstances I had to deal with for years!!!

Since starting this drug, the sweating stops sooner &amp; I don't feel hot as long. I don't feel PVCs anymore, &amp; the thought of leaving my house doesn't make me want to cry.

I take several meds and I am fine with that...I don't want depression! I have clonazePAM...which still works fairly well...I just try not to use it all the time so it remains effective.

I was told to take the lowest dose (10mg) an hour before work and see if that helped. It worked incredibly.

It worked amazingly for those situations. No more shaky hands, voice, stuttering, panic, etc. And, I still felt clear headed. My issues came when I was told to take 40mg daily for anxiety. It started messing with my heart's electrical system and caused an irregular heart beat occasionally. Basically, at night my heart rate would slow way down and actually skip a beat making me wake up in a gasp. I would also feel this when I worked out. I was told this isn't dangerous by my Dr. but that is tough to believe when it feels like your heart stops for a second.  So, occasionally, I think this drug is great.

I take 10-20mg an hour before a presentation. You still get nervous you feel your heart beating and even people can see you're a bit nervous so at least you don't look like a drugged robot. However you don't get the shakiness anymore, no more redness, and you talk with confidence. For me so far I have used it like 4 times in two years and I never saw any side effects - maybe it depends on the person and  their blood pressure whether u will have side effects or not.

That said, pathology of depression varies a lot as does individual biology - so not everyone will have this problem.

As you might of guessed it was/is difficult to fully understand propranolol's benefits as well as it's hinderances. I really want to believe it helped. Honestly no one knows how you will react to any medication until you take it and observe who you are and how you act. The doctor has broader intellect with pills and function of the brain. Put faith in your physician and have no expectations.  GO WITH THE FLOW AND TAKE NOTES!!",6,8,9

I actually switched doctors because the previous doctor I saw (in my opinion) did not know what she was doing.

I went in and spoke with my GP about this and how I didn't want to take anti anxiety medication, but I wanted something that would stop my fast heart beat and shaky hands.

I was still anxious, but my body stopped reacting so violently to anxiety, and my attacks toned down a lot. It's like propranolol took everything down a couple notches, so that instead of a 5 my baseline was a 2 and my anxiety attacks went from an 8 to a 4.

I personally have a problem with going into grocery stores and paying/chatting with an employee. After I took the medicines I left and realized that I was no longer red and did not feel shaky at all.

"Chlordiazepoxide","Maverick","February 21, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 I was given Librium yesterday in place of Ativan. I took one at noon yesterday and then worked an 8hour shift and had more anxiety than I felt I could handle. I took another Librium this morning and still have a lot of anxiety. It’s just not helping. I am not a fan of this medication.",0,1,1

Been taking librium for 2 days and the second day the dose was increased I feel like I had been given some kind of amphetamines or something I can barely sit still for 5 minutes and I feel like I could walk for ever or dance all night long no sedative effect what so ever, I'm currently taking 160mg today, I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.",0,6,1

"Chlordiazepoxide","anniess","November 9, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 I have a 30-capsule prescription for Librium (5 mg) that I use for anxiety and panic attacks.  I've had the same bottle for about four years and still have some left.  Librium calms me down but allows me to function, too.  Works in about 20 minutes for me, reaching maximum relaxation at about two hours.  I use it mostly before medical procedures but occasionally when severely upset and unable to calm down.  I tried to get my mother a prescription but her doctor insisted SSRIs are better but they weren't.  SSRI caused my mother to be unable to function, to walk or even stay awake.  Librium is great! I told a doctor who was going to do a spinal injection for me that I'd had a Librium.  He remarked, that's stuff's pretty good but no one prescribes it anymore.  I know I had a hard time getting it but it's great so I use it judiciously.",0,13,1

"Chlordiazepoxide","Bob_FL","May 10, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 Librium is different from other benzo's - it has a much longer half-life as opposed to its successor meds (Valium, Xanex, etc.). It's an oldie but goody. Have been on it almost 20 years and it does not lose its effectiveness. Also, it's synergistic with most antidepressants and has very  few side effects (for me).  Mylan makes a good generic. Most Dr.'s don't prescribe it because they think newer is better - not necessarily so.",0,33,1
"Chlordiazepoxide","Kay","January 31, 2019","-","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 So I went ER and was given Librium and zofran for the nausea. It worked great til about 3 pm the next day. I still have to take it  but not as often",0,6,1
"Chlordiazepoxide","Shawn","August 10, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 Librium worked like a charm for me. It is the original benzo discovered completely on accident. It led to Valium and then eventually all the others. Unlike the more modern medications in the benzodiazepine class, Librium is not fast acting, which was fine for me. Ativan, Klonapin, or Xanax would work, but kick in quickly, (which I assume is good for panic attacks) and had me feeling loopy and dizzy. With Librium, there was less side effects. I felt normal, just minus the anxiety. Also easy to stop taking altogether without any withdrawal symptoms.",0,42,1
"Chlordiazepoxide","MJDA","January 16, 2018","-","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 I used to suffer from panic attacks.  They occurred mostly at work.  I tried Clonazepam, but it just made me have sleepy panic attacks.  Clonazepam worked perfectly for regular anxiety though.  Librium worked like a charm.  My psych put me on 2 doses per day of 25 mg.  I would take one dose 1/2 hour before getting to work and another 2 hours later.  That didn't cover a long enough period so she increased to 3 doses per day.  I'm finding that I need 4 doses per day as my panic attacks would normally happen any time between 9am and 1pm.  Since taking it I have not had any panic attacks.",0,19,1

"Chlordiazepoxide","ImprovingNick","August 31, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have found Librium/Chlordiazepoxide to be very effective during a relatively short time (few months) of acute anxiety accompanied by IBS. My doctor prescribed Librium and it has been VERY effective. Being in the medical field myself, it is important to note that while Librium may not have the sharp relief impacts of say Ativan (just as an example), yet it is still a very effective and potent benzodiazepine that works on the same receptors in the brain that other benzodiazepines do. With my anxiety causing stomach issues, my doctor said Librium should help with both and, thankfully, it has greatly. I am calm, able to think things through, and go throughout the day on 50mg able to be more productive/less anxious and sleep better at night!",8,8,1

Also I was going through a very stressful period, and not sleeping or eating well. My GP prescribed librium for a short period of time. I found it really effective. My sleep and appetite returned and I was coping much better with anxiety. It's been two weeks now and I am going to ask if I can continue taking it for a bit longer.

"Chlordiazepoxide","jennie","April 30, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 Experienced a major, full-blown panic attack (due to stress and agoraphobia) while out with a friend. She offered Librium, two 5mg capsules. The hysteria subsided fairly quickly, but I could not stop crying, &amp; could not breathe. Two more Librium stabilised me completely. When I told my doctor, she told me rather than asking me that I slept for the remainder of that day. Nooooo....I've been telling her for MONTHS that it takes high doses of 4 different meds for me to sleep. One of those is Klonopin. For 10 years I was prescribed 6mg at bedtime. New doc came in, cut me down to 4mg, upsetting my balance, making falling asleep a chore. I hope she will take into account the Librium'so positive effect.",0,28,1
"Chlordiazepoxide","Benzo's Ran My Life.....","February 14, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 Omg! Why did it take this long (15-20) years for a doctor to prescribe this amazing medicine! I am on day 3 days, WAIT ALMOST A WEEK!, without a valium or ZANAX and I feel great! It's like the devil has left me from being a slave to my Benzo's. Driving around on a Sunday night trying to get a too soon script filled by saying I have no health insurance. It doesn't work! I feel so amazing! I do have a script for valium but I don't even want to fill it (I'm due ), but I don't freaking need it! I'm so happy! I just want to know why I only received 10pills? He also prescribed me Clonidine .1mg 4 times a day and Gabapentin 300mg twice a day. I am being compliant but Librium is a benzo! Am I going to have benzo withdrawal when I don't take Librium?",0,43,1

"Chlordiazepoxide","Jimmy1983","July 25, 2014","-","I have had these before and worked wonders for my anxiety. Recently I ran out of my usual benzodiazepine scripts early so I had to go to the ER and they gave me a 45 day supply which is cool because they only ever give maybe two days supply. But anyhow the Librium 25 mg still works great, I took two of them in the morning and was very impressed on how long it worked. Only had to take one more in the evening. And I have a VERY VERY High tolerance for benzo's.",10,13,1
"Chlordiazepoxide","Anonymous","April 22, 2014","-","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 My doctor will not prescribe Xanax, Klonopin, or Ativan for anxiety, but he was comfortable giving me a script for Librium (chlordiazepoxide) 25mg capsules 4x a day for my anxiety.  Worked well at the beginning, but like all benzo's, the efficacy wore off after about a month of use.  Was great while it worked and it was very inexpensive!  Tapered off then went back on it a few months later and it worked like a charm again! On and off usage for close to 5 years now.",0,72,1

Always turned to alcohol to solve these problems. My doctor put me on Librium and I have been on it for just over a year now, and alcohol-free. I still worry about things, but they are easy to just let go, and I sleep every night, without waking up every hour stressing over something. One thing I will say, though, is that though it has taken the anxiety out of my life, it's like it has also taken away the joy, like ALL the color is gone, not just the darkness. I feel comfortably numb most of the time. Still, better than the way it used to be! I was prescribed 25mg 3 times per day, but I take 1 pill when I get up, split the 2nd into two 1/2 doses, then 1 pill an hr before bed.",0,54,1

"Chlordiazepoxide","Anonymous","June 8, 2009","-","<b>Librium (chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 This drug did very little for me. My Doctor prescribed it as an alternative to Xanax until a full clinical work up could be done. As a moderate to heavy drinker, he did not advise me that this is used to pull people from the disease. I don't feel like I have issues with alcoholism but it really messed me up when mixing the two. Felt stoned or comatosed. Taking the drug sober did almost nothing anyway except when I take 2 or 3 at a time and still it does not release the anxiety I have.",0,31,2

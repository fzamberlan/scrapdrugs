"Diazepam Intensol","An AOL User","August 26, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","Doseage: 5mg, 6 times a day PRO: That's a lot of valium.  It helps some (6 of 10) with anxiety and cuts back my plugged into an electric socket feeling.  Helps get to sleep. It is a great muscle relaxer and helps a great deal with my muscle spasms.  Don't know what I'd do without it. CON:  Makes me sleepy.  I have to be careful to take the drug on schedule.  Otherwise I can wind up with too much in my system at once.  Dangerous when driving.  You cannot drink alcohol with diazepam.  You don't just get sleepy; You pass out without warning.  I mean pass out. Maybe OK at home in bed.  Really bad any where else.",10,28,1

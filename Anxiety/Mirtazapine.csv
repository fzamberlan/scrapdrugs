"Mirtazapine","Jasmine","June 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I switched from being on Sertraline (Zoloft) for 4 years to Mirtazapine because sertraline caused a stomach ulcer. It was hard to get used to Mirtazapine as I felt dizzy and very tired for almost 2 weeks. I slept 12-14 hours a day, and even more over the weekend.  I've always struggled with sleeping too little, this only got a little bit better over time and therefore I decided to stop as there was little left of the day. Also, I was constantly hungry, particularly for chocolate, and gained probably about 2 kilos over 6 weeks' time.",3,5,1

"Mirtazapine","debdob","May 22, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This is a very good antidepressant. it worked for severe anxiety within 3 days initially.

I couldn’t even sit upright I was so drowsy with it, so collapsed on the sofa and checked my watch which showed a heart rate in the early 30’s ! It’s like a sedative .  It’s now 24hrs later and I have more or less slept all day and still feel zoned out but recovering.  Maybe my body needed the rest, but I won’t be taking the rest of the 10 day course the doc gave me.",1,8,1

"Mirtazapine","Cassidy98","April 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on this medication mertazapine 30mg dose for 3 months now and it is not helping in any way my depression and anxiety. I struggle with an eating disorder and this is primarily why I was given this medication from outpatient. It is only worsening my ED . I am putting on a lot of weight and it is really effecting me because it is encouraging me to not want to eat . And even when I don’t eat a lot I still put on a lot of weight because of this medication. My depression and ED has worsened since taking Mirtizapine",1,10,1
"Mirtazapine","Julia","March 9, 2020","-","Started taking Mirtazapine December 31st because of my eating disorder that makes me picky with food and lack of appetite.  My main goal was to get rid of my major anxiety.  First month: nothing major happened with my anxiety. More headaches than usually. I wasn't depressed in the first place, but Mirtazapine made me feel like my life actually got more manageable and that I had more energy to do things, like study.  They increased my dose every 3 weeks because I was still having anxiety. I am now on 40mg and my anxiety is better. I do however think it's because I have a better outlook on life.  My appetite is a lot better, during these 3 months I have gained around 4kg. I never have bad eating days now so I eat regularly. About my sleeping habits: I've always been a night owl. Nowadays, if I take it around 8 PM, then I am asleep by 11:30. On the weekends I wake up around 8-10 AM on my own. I don't feel tired throughout the day.",9,40,1

"Mirtazapine","Anonymous","March 2, 2020","-","I'm a 35 year old male with a history of panic and anxiety. Have tried a number of meds, including SSRI's and Benzos. Today is day 14 on this medication the dose is a half a tablet (15mg) mirtazapine.  I have been taking it around 8pm every night, and it certainly reduces then amount of time it has taken to get to sleep every night. I am also sleeping throughout the night. Some sleepiness and flu like symptoms during the day.  On day 11, I woke up with a desire to clean my house. I haven't had a desire to carry out any activities to completion for a while. On day 12, I went and had a coffee with a friend, and proceeded to spend the entire day away from the house, seeing a movie, doing some grocery shopping, then having dinner with another friend. This kind of desire to get out and do things, or complete tasks is a fairly new thing for me. I am also finding that this is having an impact on reducing pain. I have a separate chronic pain issue and have had zero desire to take my opiate medication for pain.",8,59,1
"Mirtazapine","Paulalass","February 25, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Hi after reading the comments I thought I would share my experience of mirtazapine. After suffering from anxiety and panic attacks I finally went to doctors and was prescribed antidepressants - I think they were citalopram not sure of name but they made me worse. I was then prescribed mirtazapine they took a good few weeks to kick in. I've been taking 15mg for nearly 2 years now and feel miles better in myself. I am now able to go to the shops on my own, get a bus alone and even got a full time job.   Here comes the down side, I've put a stone and a half on gone from 9 and half to 11.  The actual drug doesn't make you gain weight it's the food you crave.  So I'm determined to try and combat that with a healthier diet. She says haha...also the dreams are horrendous and it does take me a good hour to ^come round^ when I get up. Saying this  but it is all worth while as I now feel I have my life back . I hope this helps.  Keep at it as it will be worthwhile in the end. Wishing you all well Paula x",10,56,1
"Mirtazapine","ScrewyLouey","February 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug really worked for me but I has to discontinue it.  I did experience grogginess in the morning. It took me awhile to get going, but once I was up and around, I was fine.  I’d take that over not sleeping any day.  It was also very effective for my anxiety at 15mg.  It also has no sexual side effects for me (male), which was huge.  In fact I think it may have helped my libido a bit.  Now, the bad.  I could not stop eating on it.  It was crazy. It was like something took over my body. I could eat a large pizza and a box of cupcakes, almost cry because I didn’t want to eat anymore and knew I was out of control, and then 10 minutes later be in the kitchen tearing through the kids’ cereal and whatever else I could get my hands on.  I put on 25 lbs in less than 2 months with no signs of slowing down. It really sucks because it was great in all other aspects for me.",5,21,1

"Mirtazapine","BBGL","February 14, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Mirtazapine is the only antidepressant I can tolerate (tried all of the others). I need it for GAD, PTSD and insomnia. My usual effective dose is 30mg, but I can either go up to 45mg or down to 15mg depending on where I’m at. It ‘can’ make you put on weight but it doesn’t have to if you watch your diet and exercise. Also, be aware when the carb cravings hit, try to be mindful and have some protein instead. The fog should wear off after a few weeks. I find going to bed an hour earlier most nights helps waking up a bit easier.",10,40,1
"Mirtazapine","Mike","February 12, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Take all these other reviews with a grain of salt. I think you really need to remember every body is different and so will your reaction to any medicine. As for the weight gain - if you have an increase in your appetite you have to really watch what you eat. I've been on 30mg / day for the last month and haven't had any side effects. In fact, I've been losing weight and this weight loss has continued while taking mirtzapine.

Brain fog is still present, but I don't feel completely impaired. Anxiety is returning and I feel emotionless.  I also feel like I'm at 90% mental clarity, and I get random moments of fatigue and the desire to nap. My weight is slowly coming back after dropping 20lbs in two months. Med leaves you trapped in your own body for two months dazed, blurred vision, and exhausted. It helped me, but at the cost of freedom, work, relationships.",5,18,1

The amount of panic attacks and anxiety I experience has been reduced significantly and I also now have the energy during the day to be active. When I do begin to spiral into anxious thoughts I am now much more able to pull myself out of these thoughts and distract myself. Before this was not possible. However I should note, I also made significant lifestyle changes (such as better diet, more exercise and reading), which I believe have also had a large effect on my mood and mental health.

I only felt super drowsy the very first morning and then after the first morning started to feel a bit more alert, and had good mornings to follow.

It's really helped my sleep but I struggle to get up the next morning and feel lethargic and groggy throughout the day which makes it kinda pointless to me.

I have only taken this pill once and I am scared to take it again as there is no way I can work, drive or let alone walk properly on this!

"Mirtazapine","GaGirl","January 13, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Hello, I was diagnosed with GAD about 10yrs ago along with depression and panic attacks. I was prescribed zoloft and it does help with depression but not my anxiety. I have a real hard time sleeping too. So I decided to see a new psychiatrist and she prescribed mirtazapine 7.5 right before sleep.  I started taking it and immediately noticed a quiet difference in my sleep. It doesn't knock me out like other medications did..it's like a relaxing feeling. After about a month I started noticing the want to talk more at work and to do more around the house.  I was feeling more like myself. So it helps with my anxiety too, a bonus. I urge you to try it and see if it helps. I thought I had tried everything out there.",10,44,2

Then I took my 2nd dose yesterday, and today I woke up with suicidal thoughts, I don't wanna die. I woke up and felt so depressed and anxious! This drug is awful.

"Mirtazapine","justphua","January 6, 2020","-","I have been on Mirtazapine for about one month for GAD increasing dose from 7.5MG to 30 MG. The disorientation and tiredness are life altering.  Complex tasks are hard, ability to focus, tiredness, lethargy, and blurred vision are all side effects that last into the next day. I still feel anxiety, but less intense and no panic attacks. I have read that I should give it more time at the higher dose, but there is no way I could do that outside of managed care. I was given Ativan to bridge the gaps after a panic attack sent me to the ER at 7.5MG Mirtazapine, but don’t want to be hooked on a benzo that I can’t get later. I’ll share that .25 MG of Ativan did take the edge off if it got too bad. The Mirtazapine might be helping the reflux pain as it is almost nonexistent, but the price for losing that pain is constant disorientation. I may be premature in my assessment so I’ll come back in 30 days and share an update, but this is tough going.",6,13,2

I have experience with using mirtazapine over 5 years where I have gone on and off every time  relapsed into anxiety/depression! I noticed a few people blaming this drug because it did not help them on the first night with sleep! Don’t do that! In my experience this drug helps sleep but not always the first night! I find with me sometimes it takes a week or longer before I sleep better taking this medicine! Also I have more energy from this medicine , it does not always makes you drowsy! If you are depressed it will give you energy but still let you sleep at night! Lower doses are better for sleep 7.5-15mg is best for sleep! Don’t judge this drug after one day of no success",8,32,2

Also helped so much with sleep which I struggled with due to anxiety but did feel pretty hungover in the mornings for the first few days.

Insomnia runs in my family and I was crying randomly. My therapist believes I may have manic depression and I've had GAD for most of my life. I take half of 7.5 in the morning and before bed as well as Gabapentin 100mg morning and night. I would say the first 2-3 days I was really tired and slept through the night, did not have anxiety, but mood is still the same. I'm now on day 7. I have energy through the day, I sleep well but not as well as the first couple days, and my anxiety is back but just a tiny bit where I can notice it enough to not want to lave the house.

The first day I was pretty tired but nothing too crazy, just felt like I hadn’t slept much. The first week I had a few mild side effects like increased anxiety, feeling kind of out of it. Then after two weeks I started to notice the anxiety being lifted.  I’ve been on it for almost a month now and feel like myself again and I’ve gained maybe 2 pounds but it’s well worth it! Does make me tired after about an hour of taking it but I’m not a zombie I just have an easier time falling asleep at night which is a bonus!

As a sleeping medication, mirtazapine deserves 10/10. I did experience major drowsiness the first time I took it, therefore I only took 7.5 mg for the following 6 days and then went back to 15 mg. I did not experience any drowsiness issues anymore. I was able to sleep at any time for 8-10 hours straight, after 6 night shifts in a row, no problem whatsoever resuming the normal day rhythm. Simply amazing. Mirtazapine helped a little with my depression, but it did nothing for my anxiety. I stopped it after 6 months after getting off the shift work and did not experience any problems. I did gain about 8 kg while on mirtazapine, which I lost within 2 months after stopping it. I’m now on sertraline, which did wonders for my anxiety and depression.",8,9,3

Just don't enjoy eating the way many people do.  And stress or if I have any reason to be nervous - that makes it even harder to eat.  Anyway, I've found this medicine helps a lot.  I take probably 1-2 mg (tiny pieces of my 15mg pill) once a week.  I have been able to gain weight, and whenever I fall into the rut of not knowing what to eat (for days on end), this boosts my appetite enough to pull me out of that spot.  It also helps with my anxiety.  It does dry my sinuses significantly, but I just run a humidifier in my room at night and that fixes the dry-sinus issue.",10,6,3

Apparently, this is what causes the carb cravings. So, I dropped the carbs. It was a tough 2 weeks, but RESULT! Zero craving and rather than gaining weight, I am loosing. I gained three stones on the Cit, so that's even better news. I thought that I had to choose between being fat and happy or thin and crazy. Instead, my choice is between carbohydrates or protein. It's important to make sure to get good a multivitamin that includes minerals. Also, eat plenty of green leafy veg (after transition).

The first few days taking this were difficult; there was a zombie-like hangover effect in the morning, and some anger bursts throughout the day. After pushing-through those first few days I am glad I kept taking it; my mood has balanced-out and overall I have a much better quality of life. I gained 15kg easily in the first few months of taking this, and it is difficult to keep the weight down. I crave things like donuts and cookies while taking this, it’s weird but it’s true. Unless you are very disciplined, you may have some tummy fat while taking this. After taking this for 2 years now the morning hangover effect has more-or-less gone; it is best to have early nights while on this.

I'm eating half of what I ate while taking it, working out more, and my weight is not budging. I am worried this has slowed down my metabolism long term, because before taking this drug if I got my diet and exercise right the weight would fall off rapidly. Coming off of it I could not sleep much at all, so I turned to melatonin supplements and they worked almost just as well for sleep without negative side effects.

Lately I've really had a lot of difficulties in life that have lead to my anxiety going through the roof. My Dr recommended weaning Sertraline down to 100mg a day and she then prescribed me 15 mg Mitrazapine. I take Sertraline mornings (always have and it suits me) told to take the other before bed. I've only taken 2 Mitrazapine so far, started Thursday as I was worried how I'd feel and Husband was home Friday so I figured if they made me feel terrible he'd be home with me.  All I can say is I slept really well but continued to feel sluggish and tired during the day. Took 2nd one last night before bed. Woke and had cuppa around 7.30 then slept till 9.30. Got up has cereal and figured I was still sleepy so went back to bed. I didn't wake until 1.30!!! Surely this cannot be normal. Is it?

If your curious to what it feels like when you take remeron (or if I get nervous to how this would make your feel) it’s like taking  Benadryl.

You could attribute this to a placebo effect, however this significant improvement in reducing my overwhelming anxiety continued throughout me taking it. I was on 15mg and that was enough for me. Also another side effect I had for around the first 1.5 months was increased appetite I could eat and eat and eat and I would still feel like I could continue eating. There wasn’t a point that I knew that I was satiated.  At around 3 months I started to feel like my anxiety levels were normalising I began to feel more like myself and could see through the mist.

The end is different. Very different. With the correct nutrition and exercise your body is coded to heal itself.  Withdrawal stories are real. So is the paucity of response to others in withdrawal calling out for anyone who might have made it out the other side. Two people I know didn't. Please be sure before you take this.

But I wouldn't take it during the day as I find it hard to think after taking a dose. The mornings are rough. Feels like a bad hangover. But so far it's the best combo for me.

Severe anxiety is a terrible condition and it is essential that you give these anti depressant medications time to work. To become fully effective you should give it 6 to 8 weeks and in some cases longer than that. I am also prescribed Citalapram 40mg each morning and I am improving.

I could not be happier! The nausea was better the first day after taking it, and within two or three days was totally gone. I finally have my appetite back, too. I don't know that I'd recommend this medicine to people who are overweight, but for those who can afford or even want to gain weight it can be a lifesaver!",0,84,14
"Mirtazapine","jonners","November 19, 2011","-","I have been on mirtazapine for nearly a year now. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and had had reactions to other anti-depressants I had tried. After I had gone with very little sleep for a few days, my doctor prescribed me with mirtazapine. The first night I took it, I had 14hrs sleep which was such a blessing. Before this I was so bad at one point it felt like I was having constant panic attacks and felt I was going mad but mirtazapine really helped me, when I literally thought I would never get better. I still have the odd bad nights sleep and panic attack now but nowhere near as bad. I have also put on 2 stone since I started with it but looking back on how I was, this is a small price to pay.",9,39,14
"Mirtazapine","Anonymous","September 27, 2011","-","<b>Remeron (mirtazapine):</b>			 I was suffering extreme anxiety, weight loss and insomnia due to a diagnosed medical condition.  I tried several sleep aids and SSRIs.  Nothing worked.  Because of the weight loss I was prescribed Remeron.  It was a Miracle for me!  I slept through the night for the first time in months, relieved anxiety and I started gaining weight.  Over time, my anxiety went away, but I stayed on because I loved having an appetite (I had no appetite for years).  I guess I stayed on too long.  After 6 years I decided I should get off.  I was dependent. I suffered flu like symptoms for weeks--nausea, exhaustion, gastrointestinal upset, feeling like low-grade fever.  I finally got rid of the nausea, but if I'm off for 2 weeks, the gastrointestinal upset creeps in.  I now take 3.25mg 1X week.",0,54,14

Increased appetite which subsided after a few weeks - stock your fridge with healthy food only or you will stack on the weight.  Can sleep the entire night without waking however oversleeping is a problem (10 hours) and I don't want to get out of bed (the vivid dreams are more exciting than life).  Less anxiety.  Increased concentration, less procrastination.  Sensation in my eyes (dry?) - people say I always look tired.  Restless leg syndrome for first month of treatment.  I'm surprised nobody on this forum has mentioned vivid dreams.",7,48,14

I told him my symptoms and that I was also going through Ativan tolerance withdrawal. He prescribed me Remeron and agreed to wean me off the Ativan properly. I don't know why my regular MD didn't try this miracle medicine on me! GRR!! This changed me overnight. It has STOPPED my nervous stomach and I'm eating again. I sleep good too. A few side effects would be the flashing lights you see when you close your eyes the 1st night I took it, and restless legs and vivid dreams but those are slowly disappearing.

I had anxiety with agoraphobia for five years, I can come and go as I please now. I am not able to lose weight, and I do have an appetite all the time it seems. Give yourself time to get used to the medication, and make sure you are taking enough of it. I had to take 60 mg at one time, I am now down to 45. Please do not drink alcohol, it will reverse the effects of the anti-anxiety, and alcohol is just not good for anxiety or depression ever. Good luck!",10,69,14
"Mirtazapine","Anonymous","November 11, 2010","-","Had a problem with anxiety after a major surgical complication. Doctor 1st tried a SSRI (Escitalopram). Wow, HUGE increase in anxiety and a full on panic attack. No previous psych history before this. Had to stop after 3 doses. Once I settled down tried some mirtazapine at low dose (7.5 mg). Now we're talking! Almost immediate relief of anxiety and no side effects at all! Here's a tip. Mirtazapine can be very sedating in some due to its anti-histamine effect. 1st try 50 mg of Benadryl in the daytime on a day you can afford to crash if needed. If the Benadryl zonks you avoid mirtazapine; if you aren't too sedated it is worth a try.",9,25,14

So far so good,  My sexual functioning has returned, I'm feeling generally more relaxed and carefree and am also fine in the mornings. I used to suffer in the mornings which would destroy my whole day and result in severe depression and suicidal thoughts and massive anxiety.

Usually doctors mention that when prescribing a new medicine, but this really was a great bonus. I just didn't like the weight gain, TOTAL mind/body grogginess and increased hunger ALL the following day. So I appreciated the anxiety effect and the help with sleep, but those effects (when pill is taken for a few months) slowly fade and no longer help. I pop one every so often when I need sleep now, but cannot rely on sleep medicines anymore due to such hangovers, so am off all night time medicines now. But this drug wasn't too bad for a while.

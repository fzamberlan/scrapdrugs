"BuSpar","Anonymous","June 8, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I didn't read all the reviews but I was surprised to see people with intense reactions to BuSpar, maybe they took higher doses than I did.  I've taken this drug on and off for a few years and it kind of works - it's hard to explain. I have taken probably 15-20 anxiety and depression meds in the last 10 years and many have bad side effects, buspar had none of those other than drowsiness - the only reason I keep buspar around is that it is very mild in my book - the effect is mild but the side effects are also mild or nonexistent",7,15,1
"BuSpar","Mmbwdpnz","June 3, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Do not take this drug. Had a horrible experience. Nightmares, intrusive thoughts, mood swings, apathy, angry, made me the opposite of who I am. Withdrawals are even worse so much buzzing and brain zaps. I would have rather had the anxiety/panic attacks! Still dealing with all the bizzare effects. This is coming from someone who never was on any medication. Have to take other meds just to sleep and make it through my day now. Hoping to be back to normal soon. Thank goodness for the ER staff who helped me!",1,11,1
"BuSpar","Chas","May 31, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I took Buspar for two days. On the first day my sleep was not deep and a I had weird dreams. On the second day I had a massive panic attack after my third dose of 5mg, and was unable to sleep at all that night. It was a horrendous experience. It is an awful drug for me.",1,9,1
"BuSpar","Anonymous","May 7, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’m an Iraq Veteran who has been diagnosed with PTSD and chronic anxiety. When I first started taking the buspar it would generate some level of anxiety for me because it’s a new chemical being introduced into my body. I would fight through the anxiety and keep taking the pills. After about a week I no longer had to fight the anxiety that was generated by taking buspar. I started off at 5mg and now I’m up to 30mg a day. I’ve been taking it for about 4-5 months now and have seen great progress. I know the list of  potential  side effects can generate anxiety for you by just reading them. However, the only  side effects  I noticed was a little weight gain and an increase in my sex drive.( which isn’t bad for me and my spouse). I would recommend buspar to anyone. It’s one of those drugs that it will either work for you, or not.",9,34,1

"BuSpar","California woman","March 11, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I took Buspirone when I had a back surgery and my father was sick from cancer, it was a very stressful time. I was in a panic. It helped me immediately (though I know it is supposed to take a few weeks). I remained on it for a few months as I dealt with the trauma of losing a parent. Then tapered off and went on about my business for a year. I’ve returned to the psych because I have regular anxiety and mild depression, he prescribed lexipro, I took that for 4 days and got increased anxiety and diarrhea, I decided to try to go back on the buspirone because I know that worked for me in the past. Here’s hoping it works again!",10,46,1
"BuSpar","Keno","March 10, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I wouldn’t say this medicine is horrible but it didn’t help me. I feel like this is for people with very mild anxiety.

"BuSpar","Bud","February 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I just wanted to say how UPSET I am that so many doctors are afraid to prescribe benzodiazepines for anxiety relief. They are putting us on meds such as Seroquel, and others that are NOT designed to treat anxiety. Buspar, like other SSRIs and SSDNRIs, are not effective to treat attacks of anxiety. It’s out of hand how too many docs are not prescribing REAL anxiolytics.  Buspar did not help me. I only want a PRN dose— not a maintenance med.",1,120,1
"BuSpar","Better","February 25, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Buspar from what I read is for anxiety directly related to over thinking. This is what causes my anxiety. It’s chronic. I’ve read reviews that it doesn’t work, but maybe other people get anxiety from triggers. I just constantly over think everything to the point I avoid certain situations because I fear the outcome. This drug has allowed me to overcome this and talk about issues I have with someone, resolve issues faster, be more productive, etc. it’s drastically changed my life. Friends say I’m more cordial. Basically makes you feel very calm and more carefree and to stop thinking 24/7 about silly things",10,198,1
"BuSpar","Annie","February 18, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Buspar should be classified as a hallucinogenic drug! I took it for one day (15mg.) with Zoloft to get off Ativan.  It made me lightheaded, nauseas, nervous, speedy, and when I tried to sleep I saw terrible images moving around in my head- I couldn’t sleep at all! These awful hallucinations gave me panic attacks- I was so scared!  I also had some uncontrolled jerky movements of my limbs when lying down! I called the nurse line for help because I could not reach my psychiatrist! This experience was a nightmare! I also read an FDA report that stated that Buspar can cause Tardive Dyskinesia- uncontrolled involuntary jerking movements of face and body. Who wants that?  Do not take it!",1,41,1
"BuSpar","acirod","February 18, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Buspar DOES help with anxiety, but it you have another comorbid illness like depression, it might feel like it is not helping on that area. I was on this medication for a few months and my anxiety felt really better, but my depression was still bugging me a lot so I was switched to Zoloft. Buspar helped me with the palpitations and chest pain related to anxiety, I felt like I could think better and even breathe better. It was a great medication. The only downside to it is that you can get headaches or brain zaps if you forget a dose, so put an alarm on your phone!",9,40,1
"BuSpar","KONNOR","February 17, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Have been taking Buspar 15mg 3 times a day for 3 months and didn't notice anything therapeutic at all, going to the doctor's tomorrow might ask for the max of 20mgs 3 times a day. Not sure if it is a  very ineffective med, or whether I would go as far and say it's a rubbish med",3,23,1
"BuSpar","Theanxietyfreak","February 16, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I have had emetophobia since I can remember (the fear of vomit). For the past couple months I have been dealing with horrible stomach problems and nasty anxiety attacks. When I went to the doctor they suggested I take Zoloft for the anxiety. Zoloft was the first SSRI I tried and the first night I tried it I felt extremely sick. I went to the doctor again and they put me on prozac. I took that the first day and felt okay. The second day I took it I couldn’t even get out of bed. I was super nervous to try anything else (especially SSRI’s). So my doctor prescribed me BusPar. It is not an SSRI and doesn’t have as bad side affects. I’m taking this pill 2x’s a day and I started taking last night and am now on the third dose. I haven’t felt sick at all and I hope it stays that way!! But so far so good!",8,44,1
"BuSpar","kkheflin3","February 15, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have been taking this medicine BuSpar for about 8 months. Because I also suffer from Bipolar I disorder I also take Lamictal, Provigil, and Seroquel. I take the Buspar three times a day and it took about a month to kick in. I've been on several of the benzodiazepine group before for anxiety (Valium, Xanax, Ativan) and the only advantage to those is that you can take as needed for anxiety and they work quickly. They are also highly addictive. Buspar is not addictive but must be taken regularly--not just for an anxiety attack. It doesn't work for an immediate attack. But if you take it regularly three times a day you won't have anxiety and you won't need the benzos. I think it is wonderful!",9,64,1

"BuSpar","Anonymous","January 13, 2020","-","In my experience the only think that works for anxiety is Benzodiazepines. I don't like how doctors are so quick to throw all sorts of different psychotic medications at patients when for the most part they don't really work. Just because something isn't a narcotic doesn't mean it should be overprescribed and just because Benzodiazepines are narcotics doesn't mean they shouldn't be prescribed.",0,118,1

I used to take Xanax but decided to discontinue the use of it. My doctor prescribed me this and told me to take it when needed or everyday which ever I prefer. I have zero complaints about this medication. When I first took it, I got super dizzy and light headed. But other than that it does calm me and make me feel much better.",0,46,1

"BuSpar","ALZ","December 25, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Out of the few meds I have tried Busapr has been helping me tremendously! I have initially started out on paxil then tried all three different doses of zoloft. I also had hydroxyzine added into the mix to slow down my panic attacks. My doctors were more worried about treating my depression more than anything. The anxiety was so crippling I was  literally having panic attacks almost every day and sometimes more than once a day. I finally had enough and told my doctor to take me off of the SSRI drugs(I honestly don't think that class of drugs agreed with my body anyway) and treat just my anxiety.  So far the results are amazing. I am now on 10mg twice a day and feel  a lot better. Yeah I may have some of the random side effects that come with the meds but in my case the benefits outweigh the risks.",8,76,1

"BuSpar","Nervous Rex","December 12, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Back in the early 90's I had been going through a few years of being a hypochondriac.  I had had a severe depression, and just when I was starting to feel good, my mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and only lived about 4 more months. A year or so later I started to feel bumps and lumps and all sorts of things..driving to my doctors, walk-in clinics and hospitals over and over again...just to find out I was ok and this circle went on and off from 1988 - 1991.  Thank goodness my doctor gave me a script for buspar.  I don't remember what dose I was on.  It wasn't a high dose.  But 3 weeks after taking it I literally woke up one day feeling really good and realising I didn't have to fear being sick the way I had been.  Like night and day.  I have never been on an antidepressant or any similar drug that had such a major and wonderful effect.  I didn't feel high or not myself, just the opposite.  Please try it if you have crippling anxiety!",10,88,2

Once stable, I'll go off my current anti-anxiety med. - Initial side effects: sore throat, dizziness, feeling excited (over-reacting) and bad nausea. As a result my psychiatrist told me to stop my 3 weeks of 20 mg/day. My pharmacist concurred. Unfortunately, I listened. I had 2 days of migraines. Less than a day later I was in the ER. Stiffness of the legs...excruciating pain and could barely walk. I had pain...weakness in the hands and feet. The pain in my hands was almost unbearable! I saw my PCP 4 days later. Still in horrible pain she told me to go back to the 20mg; my body was craving it. I felt relief and within 2 weeks I was fine. I'm still on 20mg. I now have had depression for a few weeks.

"BuSpar","Erika","December 1, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","My new dr wouldn't prescribe my usual combo of Prozac with Xanax as needed.  I was mad but gave the buspar for anxiety a try and it works out to be  BEST COMBO EVER!! I actually felt euphoria and a bit light headed the first few days. Then in the first few months when I had had alcohol in addition to wine one night, I got EXTREMELY SICK. But as a social drinker  decided to try again lol but only with wine. Everything has been fine since. I can even have margaritas etc again. (But I can't stress enough how scary and extreme that sickness was in the beginning, so drinkers BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.) My family says they have never seen me so happy in all my 46 yrs. I am sure that I've never had such an easy going attitude. Things I used to take personally have no effect on me now.  I take two 5mg tabs at night before bed. This works for me even though it isn't what is recommended (I.e.2 or 3x daily doses) No more obsessive worries, thin skin reactions or depression!!",10,65,2

"BuSpar","Ju","November 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed 5mg buspirone 3 times a day for anxiety. I understood that the medication would take up to a month to start having an effect. This is due to the need for buspirone to build up in your brain's receptors. I had a great improvement with my overall generalized anxiety after about 3 weeks. This is not a medication that will give you a high effect.  Sure everyone's chemical makeup is different but this is not the reason you see so many negative reviews about buspirone.",10,36,2

Now I am sleeping through most of the night without sleep aids or waking up with that nervous feeling in my stomach. I am now motivated to do things again too. I'm really sensitive to drugs but I did up my intake to 7.5mg/2x day.

By the 4th week I was a mess. I have never had such really dark thoughts before but on this drug for two weeks I was scared to even be alone because I didn’t know what I was capable of. I wanted to live but my mind would tell me different.  I had high hopes but reading these reviews I'm glad I’m not alone. I just got off of it cold turkey, 6 weeks and 4 days.

"BuSpar","SJJ","September 5, 2019","-","Buspar is the worst drug I have ever taken. It was prescribed several years ago for anxiety to cope with an upcoming surgery- and health risks associated with it. Prior to Buspar, I had never taken any depression medicine nor struggled with extreme anxiety. And I exercised often and was not taking medicine for any other health issue. Buspar sent me into a horrible, deep pit of despair, unlike I had ever known, or could even imagine anyone having. The doctor kept telling me it would take awhile to work, but after two weeks, Buspar never did. I got off of it and, while still anxious about surgery, had no more extreme depression. The despair, caused by Buspar was far worse than the surgery. If I had to choose, I would gladly have that surgery again rather than take another round of Buspar.

I knew it had to be the Buspar, as I had changed nothing else in my life.  So, after 3.5 months on, I had to make a decision - do I stay constantly hungry and have little to no anxiety, along with weight gain, or do I go off and deal with anxiety again??  I decided to go off. I quit cold turkey. ZERO withdrawal symptoms!! Has my anxiety returned?  Maybe ever so slightly... increased appetite and weight gain are not listed as possible side effects, but I’m noticing with a lot of people it seems to be very common!",8,36,3

Racing thoughts, stomach problems, constant fear and panic. This medication is not a Benzo so dont expect immediate results, for me it took approx 2 weeks before I really started to feel the effects This drug is not an SSRI and it hasn't caused any sexual problems for me as some SSRI’s are known to do. The side effects I have experienced are flushing and dizziness however they subside about an hour after taking. Buspar does have a fairly short half life and I can feel the effects diminish after about 4 hours. Im also on Valium 2mg (10 per month) as needed when my anxiety becomes elevated but while on Buspar I haven't really had a need for the Valium but I'm glad I have it just in case.

Before Buspar, I was debilitated by Social Anxiety Disorder. Avoidance, panic attacks, isolation... etc. Without Buspar, I felt like my whole body was raw all of the time. I started taking Buspar about 3.5 years ago and the first thing I noticed was sleepiness. But other than that, no side effects. It took a while to start working, but when it did, I was finally able to feel relaxed in public. The biggest thing is that it sedates the body. It makes me less reactive and slows down my mind. I can see how for some, this can produce a sluggish feeling, but it's exactly what I needed. The sleepiness is not a huge issue anymore. Oh, and I take Buspar 15 mg three times a day.

At other low periods, I was medicated for depression without benefit, and sometimes terrible side effects (Prozac: auditory hallucinations; Celexa: crazy hot flashes).

I used to feel like the world was out to get me and that I was being judged by everyone no matter where I went. I used to have the most crippling social anxiety too, I'd avoid social situations because the anxiety was so bad. Luckily Buspar erased all of that for me. Anxiety still creeps up here and then but it is absolutely nowhere close to being as bad as it was before. No side effects. I love it and will take it for a long time.

After a number of panic attacks I sought help from the doctor for a non-addictive alternative. They gave me Buspar 10mg 3x a day. This improved my anxiety but I still had days that were debilitating.

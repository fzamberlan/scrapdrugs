"Desvenlafaxine","Bob","April 1, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I felt the need to provide my experience here after reading so many other comments. This drug  b has quite honestly saved my life. Anxiety, nervousness, control issues, and related anger issues would rule my behavior and was taking a major toll on my family. I've been this drug for many years now and it turned everything around for me completely. I'm able to live a somewhat normal and happy life specifically because of this medication. I know everyone's situation is different, but taking this medication was one of the best decisions of my life, and I have no problem continuing to take it for the rest of my life.",10,23,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Anxiouschick","March 29, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I have decided to come off this medication desvenlafaxine after 10 days of nightmarish living. I haven't had panic attacks in over 10 years and yet on this medication I have had 3 in the last 10 days. If anything this medication has made me realise that my symptoms are probably really mild and that I don't need medication. My partner came home one night and literally thought I was on drugs because of how wired I was from this medication.",1,4,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Mousie","February 20, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have only been on this for 11 days, I’m really tired during the day ,and can take a three hour nap, my doctor said about three weeks and it would be a great change for me. I’m looking forward to the serotonin clicking in my brain!!! I get a bit shaky, and a bit dizzy, Little bit of brain fog. I figure after three weeks if this continues then I won’t be taking it. But honestly I’m looking forward to it working. So I’m doing this with a positive attitude!!!",8,10,1
"Desvenlafaxine","JM","February 18, 2020","-","This drug has been amazing for me. I have always been a little anxious but no issues. Then I had appendicitis that hospital failed to diagnose despite repeated visits for 8 days. This progressed to peritonitis and sepsis and I was in hospital for 5 weeks, after nearly dying. I went back to work ASAP and then realised I was on the brink of a breakdown. Constant crying and hospital flashbacks and unable to sleep.  I went to a new GP desperate for help and he recommended Pristiq. I had the first four days of side effects - bad headache, feeling out of sorts, constipation - but after two weeks I felt better. The anxiety? Turned off like a tap. No more constant running of negative thoughts or traumatic flashbacks. It has been amazing. Only issue I have with it now is some days I feel utterly exhausted but it’s not every day, and the freedom from the anxiety is the best - I am a better partner and better colleague.  I’ve never taken anti depressants before and I’m a convert now.",10,18,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","February 8, 2020","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 I'm in love with prestiq.I had a breakdown where I was just over stressed and I couldn't stay awake. I slept for 3 days straight. My doctor put me on lexapro which made me feel annoyed. I went back and asked him for some Valium.  For 2 years I took Valium every couple of days but wanted to get off it as it's not good long term but I couldn't stay awake without it, and my anxiety was really peaking when I didn't have it. I was scared to try anti depressants again but my doctor said pristiq should work so I tried it and fell in love with it. I've been on it for 3 years and it has done wonders for me. I only take a  50mg dose which has really calmed my anxiety down and dulled my flight reflex. My doctor wanted me to start coming off it but I have no interest in doing so until my kids are big. I feel I cope so much better when I am on it. Im so grateful to that doctor for convincing me to try it. In the beginning I felt a bit out of it and high for about a week, the tight jaw and shaking that went away soon",0,29,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Harold","February 6, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Great, life changing. I'm so glad I agreed to go on Desvenlafaxine, I feel like my old self again. It suppresses those feelings you have no control over regardless of how hard you try.  Some side effects included initial constipation, jittery jaw, feeling a bit dizzy, but all subsided after a few weeks. Dry mouth still persists and if I forget to take it for a day I get the dizzy type feeling, but this goes when I get back on track with it. Side effects are well worth the positives.  I have now halved the does to 25 mg (I cut a 50 mg myself as thats the lowest dose) and feel it still helps me. I am slowly working towards reducing the dose, I will see how I go through winter on 25 mg, but I will have no concerns to go back up to 50, and/or even stay on it forever if needed! It has improved my quality of life immensely.",9,11,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Igor","January 8, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I took desvenlafaxine for a few weeks, for moderate-to-severe anxiety and mild-to-moderate depression. Side effects were horrible from the beginning, increasing my anxiety and making the dizziness and the brain fogs worse. It improved over time, but in the end I was still worse than before, so I stopped it and changed the medication.",1,4,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Naninzoo","January 5, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I used to have terrible panic attacks and have had anxiety since I was a kid. Pristiq took my anxiety away. A lot of people say it didn't help them or gave them terrible side effects but for me, it was a life-changer.",9,15,1
"Desvenlafaxine","32 y/o male","October 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I’ve been on pristiq (50mg) for 18 months &amp; it’s helped reduce my anxiety immensely.  First week was tough feeling nauseous, tired, &amp; dizzy, but that all went away. However, I’ve noticed that my weight loss plateaued &amp; has hovered around the same weight since. This is besides a healthy diet &amp; gym 3-4 times a week.  I also have a minimal libido/sex drive &amp;  issues with maintaining an erection or  finishing . However, the improvement in my mental health meant I didn’t care while I was single, now that I’m dating it does get frustrating.  I’ve also noticed jaw tension as I saw another reviewer write. I also have some detachment from emotions in general, but not so severe that I feel like a robot. Missing a day can also be hell; I usually take my tablet in the morning and if I forget I feel dizzy and cannot focus by 2pm. About to talk with my GP about coming off to see how I go without meds again.",9,8,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Nathalia","August 10, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I've been taking this medicine for about 7 months. In the beginning, I suffered through some extreme side effects (my body felt really heavy, couldn't leave the bed, lot's of nausea, etc) but after 10 days it started getting better (so if you can, try pushing through the side effects). I started taking desvenlafaxine for depression and anxiety and while it has KINDA helped with my depression I feel almost anxiety-free. Before the medication, I couldn't make a phone call without having an anxiety attack, and I had some serious tachycardia but now I don't feel any of it. One downside I felt from the medication was that I started feeling really drowsy and couldn't quite focus on my everyday tasks. I talked to my doctor tho and he recommended that I start taking bupropion alongside desvenlaxine so I hope that helps! Overall, I think this is a great med.",9,19,1
"Desvenlafaxine","OilPainter1985","July 17, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been on Pristiq for anxiety for over half a decade and honestly I think it's great. Sure it's a bit of a crutch. But I've managed to achieve my university degree, meet, marry and bare children with the love of my life all while under the influence of Pristiq. I was actually prescribed Pristiq due to my anxiety and it has worked a treat. It's worth noting that I am on 200mg a day and every time I get my script filled the doc has to call up poisons control. But it's all good in the hood for me. Just have it with my coffee in the morning and try and get on with my life. I've achieved a lot while on Pristiq and I'm sure it has given me additional confidence and makes me more sexual, lasting and sensual. It's been win win win for me.",10,35,1

I am currently on day 13 and I really started to notice a difference on day 10.  They say it takes months for symptoms of depression to improve but this works pretty quickly for anxiety.  The side effects I am experiencing are constipation and brain fog. Hopefully that lets up, but I am feeling much better without being constantly anxious. My anxiety has gone from a 10 down to a 2 on a 1-10 scale.",8,28,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Loving life","April 18, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I used to have severe anxiety to the point where I had to drop out of public school and began online school. I couldn't leave the house to even get the mail, all curtains had to be closed, and I started getting extremely depressed. After 2 years of therapy and countless medications with no positive effect, my doctor prescribed me Pristiq. A few months later, I was almost anxiety free and back to public school. That was a little over a year ago, and I'm now the happiest I have ever been. I have little to no anxiety or depression anymore. The only problem I've ever had with this medicine is the withdrawal when I forget to take a dose of it (extreme dizziness and brain fog) but that's avoidable.",10,27,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Wal","January 14, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Not good for me. After the first 2 days no real side affects. Day 4, couldn't settle. Walking around the house and garden feeling sick in the stomach. Day 5. Eight hours of on and off panic attacks. Night five, extreme anxiety all night. Day six did not take it and resumed to normal by the afternoon. Awful reaction. Never again!!",1,16,1
"Desvenlafaxine","June22","January 1, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have suffered from moderately severe anxiety for most of my life. No depression. I took Paxil CR for about 3 years and it worked very well for about 2 years, then stopped working. Switched to Pristiq and feel much better. It took about 3 weeks to notice any change in my anxiety, but it definitely works. I've been on 50mg for a month now. Only side effects are dry mouth and some excessive tiredness, but that is so much better than being on edge all the time. Some reduced appetite, nausea and insomnia when first beginning this med but has since gone away. Only gave 9/10 because I'm only a month into this med and probably haven't reached the full benefit yet. Also take Xanax a few times a week (1mg), and while that works amazing for situational anxiety, it doesn't work for generalized all day everyday anxiety. Pristiq is working very well for me! Hope I don't jinx it.",9,32,1

So I went back to the doctor and started this medication after 2 weeks I felt human again . I was myself for months but then I forgot to pick up my prescription and then it was a holiday and I thought it would be ok because it took so long to go into my system ... I was crying in the line at the pharmacy because my chest hurt and I could not breath my anxiety was back and bad . It was not ok do not miss a few days when you have bad anxiety it is still there waiting to overtake you :(  I am back on it and doing well .I now am on a ready fill program that will call me a few days before I run out so it never happens again .",9,29,1
"Desvenlafaxine","EJK","November 13, 2018","-","I researched this medication for a year before deciding to try it because I was so nervous about side effects. I have had terrible side effects from other medications that were recommended for anxiety, including Lexapro, propranolol, Ativan, and buspirone, and they didn't noticeably decrease the anxiety (never mind the actual nightmare of coming off Ativan).  I decided to try adding Pristiq, which was on my recommended list from genetic testing. The side effects I have experienced are EXTREMELY minor and my anxiety began to abate within only a week. It got better every week I was on it, and I've now been taking it for nearly six months. The difference is night and day.  I experienced insomnia for about the first two weeks I was on it. I also experienced constipation. I feel like I sleep better with it. I take 50 mg a day. I know Pristiq is not for everybody and I was very nervous about taking it, but I'm so glad I tried it. I plan to keep taking it as long as it works.",10,41,1

The first couple days I was filled with anxiety but I started a new medication so I pushed on. About the 4th day of taking it I got super light headed and fainted. I called my doctor told and he told me to drink more water and so I kept with it.   I was still feeling light headed every so often.  The second week I had a good two days of no anxiety felt like it was working, then the next day a wave of thoughts and anxiety crashed into me again.  I kept with it because doc said two to three weeks, well after a month of taking it. It didn't get any better.  Actually it got  much worse, more anxiety on this medication than ever before. This did not work for me and I get that everybody is different but I've tried a lot of different medication but this was definitely the worst.",1,14,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Pristine","July 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Please give this drug a try if you are unsure. For years I have tried to avoid taking medication due to an extremely negative experience with paxil as a teenager. Over the years I have tried natural remedies such as hypnotherapy, therapy, bodytalk, reflexology, meditation and exercise. I have always suffered from extreme shame and severe anxiety. I hit a recent downward spiral of depression and I was scared of what might happen and called my doctor. I have been on pristiq for 2 months and regret not taking it sooner. My anxiety is at an all time low and my depression has subsided. My motivation has returned and even my confidence. I was scared to try it with all of the negative reviews but so happy I did. I initial noticed loss of appetite and trouble sleeping the first 2 weeks then after that it has been smooth sailing. The only issue I now struggle with is trouble reaching orgasm but if that's my only issue. I'll take it. I have also continued body talk and therapy",10,40,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Bob","April 25, 2018","-","I started by taking 25mg at night at around 8:00PM, didn't go to sleep till 2:30AM, and strangely wasn't very tired. As I laid in bed, I felt an overwhelming sense of panic creep in which slowly grow much, MUCH worse. I ended up getting out of bed and paced back and forth inside my room, where my mind felt like it was racing at 1000x a second. My body began to shake, my vision decreased slightly, I lost my coordination, felt it very hard to concentrate, and at one point it felt like my legs wanted to give out from underneath me. Most importantly, I had the biggest panic attack I've ever experienced, and was very heavily breathing. I may have been experiencing something known as Serotonin Syndrome, which can induce seizure. Thankfully I had some Clonazepam on hand and took a small dose to calm myself down which helped significantly. I will be indefinitely discontinuing the use of all SSRI and SNRI's in the future, courtesy of the side effects of desvenlafaxine.",1,8,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Cekropian","February 13, 2018","-","I have not been on this too long, but so far so good. I did a DNA saliva test a few years back with a mental health nurse practitioner, and Pristiq came out as my number one choice. Since it was not in generic form at the time, I opted for choice #2, generic Paxil, for insurance/money reasons. That has worked very well for my anxiety for 3 years, but the one side-effect that has driven me nuts was always feeling sooo tired in the morning. Since the generic for Pristiq has come out, I decided to switch, and I already feel more awake and energetic in the morning. I have tried a plethora of anti-anxiety meds over the years, always with side effects or they just quit working. Knowing that everybody has a different body chemistry and reactions to medication vary greatly, I HIGHLY recommend doing the DNA test if you can. It has been a real life changer for me and the change from generic Paxil to Pristiq has been seamless.",9,21,2

The first two days were unpleasant, felt like I had a cold and my sleep was not great.

This medication however, has been a lifesaver. I feel fantastic and very much like myself.

Since being on Pristiq I've flown (with no anxiety issues at all) across the U.S., then to Europe, then to Hawaii. It also helps me with daily issues as well. The only drawback for me really is that I'm a little too calm now. I don't get excited about things as much as I use to. No more excessive worrying but also not too much joy either.

Pristiq is already calming me down. I havent had heart palpitations. My thoughts alone would create the heart palpitations and the effexor wasnt doing the job anymore in avoiding the phsysical sumptoms of anxiety.

With Pristiq I don't experience much in the way of side effects. My doctor told me to watch out for fatigue, as it is a common side effect, but I was tired even before starting Pristiq so I can't comment on that. Recently I read about grinding teeth as an effect and finally I was able to explain why I have been doing that every day. But that's it for me. It has helped a lot with anxiety.

"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","May 22, 2009","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 I can only say good things about Pristiq. I was on Lexapro for about three years and gained about 35 pounds. My doctor switched me to Pristiq. The hardest part was weaning off the Lexapro and the couple of weeks it took for my body to adjust to a new medicine. It has been about a month now and I absolutely feel great, energized, my appetite seems more normal. I have lost three pounds in four weeks. Not bad since I wasn't really trying. The unusual changes I noticed at first on Pristiq was really weird dreams and sometimes at night I felt a little tense. But now I just feel great. Also unusual in my case, my doctor told me to take it in the morning but I was afraid of nausea so I take it at night.",0,49,6

I'm also on Suboxone for pain. I've noticed that I smoke more now, which might be from financial problems. I get constipation bit more but minimal problem. I have to take it in the morning like many people say or it keeps me up. Weird how different it affects people - some people say it helps them sleep. Goodluck folks.",0,21,6
"Desvenlafaxine","Megan84","April 30, 2009","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 I'm 24 and have been taking Pristiq for about 6 weeks now. The first 3 weeks were hell. I went through horrible emotional spells. I would cry then get angry for no reason. I would just want to be left alone. My husband and my family were so worried about me. I wasn't myself at all, my mood changed so frequently. Now I am feeling balanced - I haven't had an anxiety attack for about 4 weeks now. I never thought I would get here. The only thing I am experiencing now is trouble sleeping but that's been going on a while, and a slight decrease in my sex drive. If that doesn't change in the next couple of weeks my doctor wants to put me on Wellbutrin, we'll see how that goes.",0,12,6

The side effects were horrible as I started - extreme dizziness, nausea, restlessness, sweating, impotence.  Those subsided over the first week or two, but quickly returned if I miss a dose.  My energy level has not lifted and in fact may have decreased, but most importantly I've felt more disconnected, numb, and unfocused since being on the drug.  I've heard it's rough to come off and I've been tapering back slowly, but I'm looking forward to clear thoughts and true feelings again.",0,15,6

I have had severe panic attacks and insomnia since my tubal ligation almost a year ago.  I have been through a lot of medications that only left me to feel like a zombie and I am finding that you can compare yourself to others and put yourself in a box or you can realize that God made us all in a unique way and just because one drug works for one person does not mean it will work well for another.  I am still going to take it one day at a time and stay in prayer that the doctors I am seeing will give me medicines to get me the balance my brain needs, to have a healthy and normal life.",0,32,6

Some nausea and a little constipation, but please - if that is the trade off to feel much better - than so be it. Not planning on a long-term relationship with Pristiq, however. Using this in conjunction with therapy so I can have some relief while I work through finding the real emotional root of my problems. Pristiq is only a band-aid while I try to heal whatever wounds. Give Pristiq a try, everyone reacts differently, but it has truly been amazing for me so far. Good luck to you, all.",0,91,7

I feel so much better. The first two days I was jittery and the first week slightly queasy but I noticed by day two an increase in my energy and desire to do my everyday activities and a DECREASE in my appetite.  I have no desire to binge eat like I do when my anxiety is bad. I have so much more patience with my children. I still have anxiety but it is calmed with Klonopin and I am starting Buspar this evening before bed. The only bad thing is that it has been very constipating for me. I drink prune juice and have added fiber and Metamucil but it is still a problem. I have taken many meds over the years but I truly find this a miracle drug.",0,109,7

I also experienced extreme dizziness, but only for the first few days.  I have to admit those symptoms do not outweigh the benefits.  Like many others, I am much more clear headed and focused.

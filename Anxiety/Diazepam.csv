"Diazepam","Monkey","June 8, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","Hi Unfortunately I was put on valium 48 years ago as I was told by GP I had a nervous stomach.  After 3 years I had an ovarian cyst that burst so had cyst and ovary removed.  Heyho after operation I didn't have stomach ache so stopped taking valium. But then I had panic attacks, shakes  and agoraphobia. I went to GP who told me you must always take valium or you will end up in a mental health facility. I have tried on occasions to cut down stop them.  Side effects shaking tight band round head throat huge weight loss bedridden.  For a long time I have taken  25mg daily.

This drug for me helps me as long as I have it under control. I find myself always having to be wary of my dosage. This allows me to pretty much go about my normal life, allows me to function, think and gives me the motivation and willingness to do the things I need to do. When on these and under control I find a lot of aspects of my life all coming together where as without it I feel helpless. Too much valium daily however leads to depersonalisation and impulsiveness. Before you know it you will be turning into something else, it is only in hindsight that this becomes apparent. As quickly as this can help improve your life it can crumble it. CONTROL YOUR DOSAGE. So if you can control yourself absolutely I would recommend but be wary it is very easy to lead yourself down the path of a benzo addiction, I have done this become clean and reused several times now.",0,9,1

I had two tablets left from an old bottle, and the difference was too great to even compare. The withdrawal symptoms went away. That bottle had a much older expiration date (6/2020).

Going to the Movies, out in crowds, traveling by plane, I even lost my stutter, the list goes on. I suffered an Aortic Aneurysm rupture in 2014 because of a stressful phone call. Now there seems to be draconian measures in place to stop all use of this drug. For those of us who don't abuse it I don't care if it is physically addictive. The benefits out weigh the negatives in my case. Now I must find a Doctor that understands that my case is Mental/Physical.

I have always had severe generalized anxiety and was never adequately treated for it, just given seroquel which made me non-functional.  The loss of my husband exacerbated the anxiety condition and I began suffering from insomnia as well. My Dr tried me on a variety of benzodiazepine meds which didn’t last long enough in my system to give me adequate relief. We eventually gave diazepam a try and it worked so well. I started on 20mg a day and over the years I have tapered to a comfortable dose of 10mg daily. It does not make me sleepy or loopy but takes the edge off enough that I can care for my children and function in daily life. Yes there is a bit of a dependence but for me it’s worth it to be somewhat addicted rather than struggle to cope with terrible anxiety symptoms every day.

He increased the dosage and quantity. Soon I was getting through the day with up to thirty pills. I experienced multi organ failure earlier this summer, and subsequent heart failure.  My primary doctor recommended a new psychiatrist, who was shocked at my regimen. He said he wouldn’t see me until I had beaten the addiction. It was tough.

Usually it calms me right down even with just 2mg (I'm allowed to take up to 5 pills a day every 2 hours but the most I've had has been 2 pills in a day) I do sometimes start panicking after taking it just because the pill itself scares me with all the horror stories regarding it.

Exercise and meditation worked best for me in the past but living in noisy social housing makes that option impossible, so diazepam is the next best thing.

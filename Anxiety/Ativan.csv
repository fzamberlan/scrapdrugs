"Ativan","Honey bunny donuts","May 25, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I have been on Ativan 1mg for almost three years now and whenever I’m super angry, anxious, jumpy it works wonders. For the past week I’ve been crying uncontrollably because of certain things going on and when people don’t show me any concern or comfort me I get irrationally angry and even chased my little sister for showing no sympathy. I’m a 23 year old woman and she’s a 16 year old girl so she’s got her own problems. I immediately took an Ativan and within 20 minutes they kicked in perfectly. I didn’t have an urge to cry anymore, I felt calm and relaxed, And kind of high and had a rational thought process. This is what effects Ativan usually has on me and sometimes I feel goofy and laugh at the most random things. But regardless I ?? This drug and couldn’t ask for better. I’ve been on clonazepam that’s ok but not as good as Ativan and I’ve been on Xanax once at the hospital but that made me even more anxious and my muscles jerked. I love Ativan so much",10,6,1
"Ativan","Mnich","February 5, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Has gotten me through many sleepless nights and panic attacks. I only take it if I absolutely need to, to help me at night time when my anxiety is at its worse and only a dose of 0.5 mg. It almost always makes me sleepy and helps me sleep and normally I don't feel to groggy the next day.",8,46,1
"Ativan","Dallas720","February 3, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I've been on this medication since 2018 and it works wonders for my anxiety. The first time I took it was when I was having an anxiety attack in the mall when it was really crowded. I usually take 1mg along with drinking juice, water or even soda never grapejuice. The effects kick in between 45 min and 2 hours and I feel extremely calm, happy, silly and even loopy. I wish the effects lasted longer than 8 hrs though but I still love this drug regardless",10,29,1
"Ativan","Drugs","January 17, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Ativan does the job. But you do NOT want to go through the withdrawal. It's very bad. I have generalized anxiety and panic disorder to the point where I can't leave the house unless I really have to. And ativan makes it a lot easier to leave the house. The withdrawal makes your anxiety come back with vengeance. It's bad. For the short term it's great but long term you become addicted and physically dependent on it. And you build a tolerance so it doesn't help you as much as initially taking it. I love ativan and recommend it to anyone suffering from anxiety. Just make sure you wean off it or you will feel like a life becomes a nightmare.",9,37,1
"Ativan","Jay","January 13, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Safe and effective medication as long as you do not become dependent on it.  PLEASE avoid getting hooked on this medication as it is a benzo and withdrawal from benzos can be deadly.   Has helped me manage severe panic attacks due to anxiety, depression and ocd.  I take 0.5 mg if I am having a severe panic attack and it immediately helps take the edge off.",10,33,1
"Ativan","mitch","December 14, 2019","-","I literally took one dose of 1.5 mg's of lorazepam after being prescribed the drug for panic attacks and anxiety. It worked for the panic attack, but since that 1st dose I haven't slept in 3 days. Reflecting on it now I would have rather just gone through the full on panic attack. This drug is no joke",2,15,1
"Ativan","Hs","October 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This is by far the scariest experience I have EVER had with a drug. Ativan immediately took the anxiety away but the after effects were horrible. I took it intermittently for 2 weeks and then noticed when I didn't take it consistently my anxiety was 100 percent worse. I was crawling out of my skin and so irritable. I also had uncontrollable muscle shaking and memory problems. This drug is very dangerous for some people. I'll stick to cognitive behavioral therapy.",1,38,1
"Ativan","Miss K","October 21, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I had been having extreme anxiety and panic attacks for 4 or 5 days and didn’t feel like I could handle them on my own anymore. I went to the ER and they gave me Ativan to calm down. I’m not sure what the dosage was but it was in pill form. At that point I had been crying non stop for 3 hours as I was very scared and my heart was beating very fast. Within half an hour or so I could feel the medication working as it took the edge off of my anxiety. When I went home I immediately fell asleep and stayed asleep. I also hadn’t been sleeping well so that was a relief. It worked really well for me, but I only took it at the ER and haven’t taken it consecutively as a prescription. The only downside was I felt very groggy and foggy the next couple of days, but that could be attributed to exhaustion. Overall it really helped me a lot.",8,39,1
"Ativan","Anonymous","October 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Ativan amplified anxiety so bad I could not stop vomiting.",1,14,1
"Ativan","Jr","October 17, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I like Ativan better than valium but not xanax be careful on any benzodiazepines. They will mess with your brain up cause memory loss. I've been on them for 20 years. No way can I go off them now. I'm screwed. I tried twice and went insane. I kicked a 4 year opiate addiction with the help of suboxone and that was hard. Kicking benzos makes kicking opiates like candy. Trust me benzodiazepines  are dangerous. My Dr never warned me of the addiction until I switched drugs. About 5 years in. Isn't that nice? I live with them they keep me calm. I have very bad anxiety but knowing what I know now I would have took a shot of vodka a couple times a day. I'm not a drinker but it beats the side effects of benzos. Moderation is the key.",5,41,1
"Ativan","Star","October 7, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been taken Ativan  since 2008 for the last five years I went up from 2 mg a day to 3mg I want to get off this drug because I feel my brain is cloudy.  I went to my doctor and he gave me a schedule how to wean off but his schedule is not working for me I've been trying to wean off for the last 2 weeks and I finally got down to 2 mg today I feel a lot of anxiety and I had to take another half milligram the calm me down. Does anyone have any suggestions do I need to go to a hospital I have no family to help me ?",10,33,1
"Ativan","Happy customer","September 21, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","the doctor gave me Ativan for treating bad anxiety/panic attacks. I just take 1/2 of a 1mg pill when I’m experiencing a panic attack. (The doctor was very reluctant to prescribe it as it is a benzo) but in my opinion it is 100% better than the long term stuff which just completely messed up my moods and made me depressed which I never was before.  I keep the Ativan with me and if I start to feel a bad attack coming on I have 1/2 a pill and am completely fine again within 15 mins. It’s been a life saver for me as my panic attacks would sometimes last days and I’d be throwing up, the whole deal. Ativan has really helped, I’ve only had to use it twice in six months, but just knowing it’s there if I need it is great. The only side effect I get is drowsiness but usually I take it at night anyway so it’s good. I also get a lot of relief from cognitive behavioral therapy like tapping and meditating.",10,46,1
"Ativan","EE","September 15, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I absolutely hate it. I was given Ativan  last summer when I was having a total mental break down. At first I waited and waited and felt absolutely nothing whatsoever, then I realized that it made me even more anxious and caused me to lash out at my parents. They ended up having to take me back to my house because they just couldn't deal with me. I decided to get some drinks at the bar and then at the cider house, and Thats When It Finally Started To Kick In. I was having a lot of trouble talking and had all these weird muscle jerks and having maybe convulsions.",1,9,1
"Ativan","Nervis Jervis","August 18, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Do not hype yourself up about addiction, but do know certain people will be at risk more than others, high stress jobs (where people's lives are on the line), addictive personality, or using these to solve problems, should find other ways to cope. The .05 pills are gentle, they take the edge off. Things like alcohol, and opiates seem like they are WAY more addictive.  I had to deal with my mom who had a high stress job and was HORRIBLY addicted to Xanax, almost died taking them. I refused to take benzos my whole life for that reason until I just recently needed them due to a miscarriage. Will only use them as needed (during PMS) I had absolutely NO withdrawals or odd sensations the next day after taking. Have seen what benzos do to some people. I am hoping that not to be me, nor do I get the withdrawals people say they get the next day. Everyone reacts to drugs differently. I cannot tolerate MJ, most other people can.",0,29,1
"Ativan","Speced","August 8, 2019","-","Lost my husband suddenly right next to me of a stroke during the night.  It was a shock. I have PTSD, anxiety, and depression.  Use Ativan in tiny dose to sleep . Do wake up very drowsy and super sensitive to meds. Can be addictive but not for me. Calms me while grieving.",8,54,1
"Ativan","Zion","July 29, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve done research as I suffer from anxiety I had a doctor prescribe me Xanax and from all I’ve read online they are almost identical to each other. I would rate Xanax much Lower than Ativan. Ativan truly cures anxiety and all I need is 1 pill for 3 days and I feel normal and functioning. Xanax makes you feel drunk and wake up with an anxious  hangover . Must be my genetic make up but I highly prefer Ativan just do not abuse it. You must respect this medication",10,46,1
"Ativan","Inkaisua","July 25, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I’ve been taking Ativan on an off for the past 9 years. Started on 0.5 mg, moved  up to 1 mg per day as needed. I’ve heard and read about addiction horror stories, but I’ve personally never had to up my dose (except going from 0.5 to 1 mg) and haven’t had the urge to take more than prescribed. I suffer from major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Ativan helps my anxiety immensely. Especially useful for full-blown panic attacks - within half an hour I feel normal again. At first it made me sleepy, but as my body got used to it, that side effect went away. There was a time when I was having debilitating anxiety on a daily basis, and my pdoc advised me that I could take up to 4 mg per day. Thankfully, I haven’t had the need to take that much. Overall, Ativan is a great medicine. I could go days without taking it with no adverse effects (I.e. withdrawal). This medicine works well for me. Good luck!!",10,62,1
"Ativan","PN78","July 23, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This would be my 3rd time in 14 years of getting a weeks’ worth prescription of Ativan(0.5mg). I never seem to take them all.  Does calm anxiety and with the low dosage. I don’t get drowsy or have any other side effects. I would suggest taking a pill only when necessary. I could see how this could become habit forming. Sometimes you just naturally need to fight through an anxiety episode.",9,31,1
"Ativan","M","July 19, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was put on a low dose of Ativan by my PCP one week ago for an unusual and isolated anxiety attack. He gave me a month supply (2x a day) plus 20 mg of Celexa for depression.   Ativan makes me very very drowsy (definitely not anxious or depressed!) It's meant to have a calming effect on severely anxious individuals or help ease insomnia.  I've read Ativan is prescribed to calm patients before surgery. I may have had it before surgery, but right now I believe it's unnecessary and overkill.   I thought the Celexa was causing the fatigue!",3,4,1
"Ativan","A~","July 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Ativan is an amazing drug to take for sleep and for anxiety however proceed with caution if you struggle with depression and are not on other meds for depression. I started taking Ativan for insomnia and for anxiety but it unmasked depression for me and put me in a real dark place and all I did was cry before I would finally go to sleep. I slept amazing but like I said, it made me feel more depressed. :( So for that reason I had to stop taking it. But it is the best for sleep, I always woke up feeling super refreshed if I took Ativan the night before and it didn’t make me have any crazy dreams like some meds for sleep can do. Like I said, only side effects for me were worsening depression and sometimes upon wakening feeling confused. Other than that, I highly recommend Ativan ??",0,17,1
"Ativan","Gentleman","June 9, 2019","-","Addiction, dependence, and abuse are all 3 very different things and carry different definitions and connotations.  I see many worried about addiction.  As with any of the many drugs that change a physiological function, our bodies can become up or down-regulated and normalize the presence of the drug. Any mammal reducing or discontinuing certain drugs, like Ativan, can experience dependence, characterized by physical and emotional distress at withdrawal. This is should NOT alone be considered ADDICTION. Addiction often involves dependence, but that's not all. If you discontinue Ativan and find yourself drinking uncharacteristically more, or pursuing other chemical ways to cope, you may have a valid addiction concern.  Phy./emo. dependence, is not the only criteria for AdXN. Dr's are generally accepting of this and should take no offence. Consult an expert, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol are the only common substances that can be dangerous if d/c'd suddenly.",8,14,1
"Ativan","Sam","March 20, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I had a health issue that started my panic attacks for two months. Started taking 1/2 Xanax and continued having panic attacks. After seeing the Dr. she gave me two 1 mg. of Ativan. In 15 minutes or so I was so calm and relaxed! Ativan really makes you very comfortable fast! I love that! Started on Zoloft for a long term fix. Now on 50 mgs a day. Wanting to get off both Ativan and Zoloft, I researched homeopathic options and found that L-theanine and Ashwagandha and Magnesium all have amazing reviews. So I’m going to try the combination of the three. Will be receiving the L-theanine and Magnesium today. I will update as soon as I see results! Hopefully will wean off of Zoloft and Ativan! God bless anyone who suffers!",10,71,1
"Ativan","Garnetred","March 18, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","With diagnosis of PTSD, anxiety, major/clinical depression, adult onset ADD with BPD on the side, ativan has been in my life for a while and I have never had a problem with it and its never negatively effected my life.  It's maybe saved my life  a few times.",10,48,1
"Ativan","Hypochondriac Gal","March 11, 2019","-","I was diagnosed with panic disorder at 8 years old, and when I was 13, the panic attacks became severe. My psychiatrist finally prescribed me 15 pills per month of 1 mg of Ativan. I’m now 18, and just went through a really hard time. I relapsed into severe anxiety, had to quit all my schooling. My panic attacks can last for hours, and this is the only thing that provides relief during those sleepless nights. If it weren’t for Ativan, I’d have gone to the hospital 30 times now.  It is pretty easy to become dependent. I’m tapering off, went from 0.5 mg per day to 0.25 mg, to skipping days. The withdrawal symptoms are not terrible, but they’re definitely uncomfortable. I suffered vertigo, insomnia, and increased anxiety. Advice to anyone taking this medication: Never cut cold turkey. Although rare, it can cause seizures if you stop the medication suddenly. Also, it’s very easy to become dependent on it. Please be careful.",10,50,1
"Ativan","Pumpel","March 2, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I’ve been taking Lorazapam for about 15 years for sleeping. It works wonders. Six weeks ago I went through a very stressful time and my anxiety went through the roof. I hesitated for weeks about taking another 0.5 during the day because my fear of getting hooked on this. Finally gave in the other afternoon and I was my normal self that night and all next day. Then the following day I was back to being anxious. So disappointing because I had hoped something got jarred into place. I'll try cutting the day one in half and see if I can do that for a few days. I do like this drug.",10,33,1
"Ativan","Bear","February 17, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have extremely bad anxiety that started at 8 years old when my essential tremor started. It’s a vicious cycle. Shaking causes anxiety, anxiety causes shaking to become more pronounced and it leaves me in constant fear. Anxiety became so bad recently that I had to go to the ER! I couldn’t even leave the house. Doctor gave me 1mg of Ativan within 30 minutes was calmer than I felt in months. It was SO hard to find a psychiatrist that would prescribe them but I did and now I take .5mg as needed but literally when needed!! I have 90 pills but have only needed 1. I force myself through the moderate anxiety as I am terrified of becoming addicted. (I DO NOT have an addictive personality though, never have) anyways I find these a absolute life saver and for some reason just knowing I have them on me calms my anxiety. I 100% recommend ONLY when needed in extreme cases!!! Force yourself through the moderate anxiety.",10,56,2
"Ativan","Jim","November 30, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Got on this after a nervous breakdown due to my mom nearly died and my job announced they were closing. I started having my heart skip beats which sent me spiralling into about two weeks of severe insomnia, depression, and panic. When I went to my doctor in tears he prescribed me Ativan. That night I finally slept.. and I kept taking 0.5mg for a week. I then began to improve so I began to taper to 0.25 mg and the second day on it I had withdrawal symptoms of a headache, panic, and nausea. The symptoms lasted 2 days and have finally subsided. I plan to taper again after another week. This medicine works wonders but you need to have an exit strategy fast.",9,26,2

"Ativan","EJK","November 13, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Yes, it will stop panic attacks, but good luck coming off it. I was having severe anxiety after a bad spell of taking Lexapro, which made my anxiety worse and gave me constant panic attacks, so my doctor had me taking .5 mg three times a day. I was so grateful to have some relief that I didn't question the dose, but the more I read about dependence, the more nervous I became. I started tapering off it after only a month and I thought I was going to die. Hallucinating, insomnia where I didn't sleep for days, couldn't keep down solid food, crippling depression and agoraphobia...it was a nightmare and I was contemplating checking in to a hospital. I eventually transitioned to buspirone and eventually Pristiq. Such a nightmare. I can't recommend Ativan to anyone who may be sensitive to benzos.",1,20,2

The antidepressant she  is taking doesn't seem to help her at all. So we took her to the hospital because we  don't know how to help her.

I spoke with my PCP about trying this instead of Klonopin and she was ok with that at 1 mg twice a day as needed. The first week was fine and then during week two I was having a lot of panic attacks, chest tightness and insomnia. I suffer from MS so never sure what is MS related or anxiety caused problems.

"Ativan","Sailor_Jupiter","August 7, 2018","-","I used to take Ativan for appointments &amp; other anxiety-provoking situations. It would relieve anxiety for the dental appointments &amp; ENT appointments but that was it. It never reduced my anxiety for blood tests or other appointments, despite the fact that I did not have any other drug given to me for the Dental or ENT appointments.  It also worked for certain anxiety-provoking situations (such as public speaking) but only 50% of the time. However, I am epileptic &amp; on anti-seizure medication. Despite the fact that I am on anti-seizure medication, I will always have a Simple-Partial Seizure 4 days after I last took it, even if it was only 0.5 mg (the highest dose I would have would be 2 mg).

Doc says I'm SUPER sensitive to meds.   Because I take it so sparingly, I have not developed tolerance , but I am dependent on this medication for my agoraphobia and panic attacks.

I've used Ativan many times in the past but no doctor will give it to me on a long term basis sighting addiction.  My husband took it daily for years.  Why am I not able to get a long term prescription? Ativan is a lifesaver for me, eliminates the muscle stiffness and pain and gives me energy.

It works for me. For now. My mom took it for 15 yrs. She's 64yrs old. It works great for her. Anyone taking this should walk, exercise or so a hobby you like. Sauna always helps.

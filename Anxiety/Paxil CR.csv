"Paxil CR","Anonymous","January 1, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I took Paxil CR for anxiety for about 3 years. My max dosage was 67.5mg a day, which is too high. Paxil worked amazing for me for about 2 years at 37.5mg a day. After 2 years it started to lose efficacy, and that's when they kept raising my dosage. My main side effects were increased appetite (gained 20 lbs) and excessive sleepiness. Some nights I would sleep for 18-20 hours unintentionally. This was somewhat problematic. This drug did give me my life back when it worked and it did work very well for my anxiety for 2 years. Despite what people say, tapering off Paxil was not hard at all. My psychiatrist said that this is one of the stronger SSRI's that generally works fast and is great for anxiety.",7,5,1
"Paxil CR","somebody1278","August 28, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Started taking this about 3 weeks ago. I was having crippling anxiety symptoms. I feel much more levelled out - and don't feel affected in terms of clarity or my ability to think. My physical anxiety symptoms have much lessened and they're not a constant distraction, as they were before I was taking this. Very pleased my clinician put me on this. I've only had one possible uncommon side effect, there was a few days about a week in wherein I felt like my pupils were more dilated than usual (I would look at my pupils in the mirror and they seemed larger, but because I wasn't actually comparing this to before taking the medication, I couldn't be sure that this is what I was truly experiencing), but it was never for more than several minutes at a time; this side effect disappeared around the 2 week mark.",9,4,1
"Paxil CR","Aitezaz","May 15, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","It will do nothing negative. Give it a try to enjoy life.  Life is short. Don't take the burden of social anxiety and panic attacks for your whole life. If you still feel terrible when taking Paxil use inderal as well and you will see an improvement in life. My score for Paxil CR is 9/10 in just  days.  PS if you ignore this illness it will give you IBS, high BP, anxiety, messes with career goals, gives heart problems, sleep problems, low energy, you need short naps, always low confidence and so on.  I avoided medicines from age18 to 28 years and now finally I took the step for paxil. Stay blessed ....",10,30,1
"Paxil CR","happy bunny","October 7, 2016","-","After 5 years on Paxil, then 2 years on Paxil CR, I weaned myself off in 2 months. I had severe nausea, and abdominal pain for 3 months. I am back on Paxil 10 mg.daily, under a Physician Assistant's care to eventually wean off. Nausea is gone, as is the abdominal pain. It was so bad for those three months, I was hardly able to function, because of the extreme nausea.",8,3,1
"Paxil CR","June1978","June 12, 2016","-","Am able to drive around town way better, but not on freeways or bridges. Sometimes feel dizzy when tired or overexerting. Doing more fun stuff",8,7,1
"Paxil CR","happy on paxil cr","October 15, 2011","-","I have health-related anxiety issues.  Ten years ago I took 25 mg Paxil CR for about a year and it was a life-saver.  No side effect, no withdrawal issues.  A month ago my anxiety returned for a new reason. My doctor started me on 20 mg citalopram. I think I had every side effect possible and made my anxiety worse.  I switched to 12.5 mg Paxil CR and within three days was a new person.  For me, there is no better medicine.",10,49,1
"Paxil CR","Anonymous","September 28, 2009","-","I love it. It works for me very well. I take 25mg every morning.",10,21,1
"Paxil CR","Anonymous","July 3, 2008","-","I was taking Prozac for few years to treat my symptoms of depression, but I could still feel anxiety and irrational fears (like being alone in the house), then my therapist suggested to switch to Paxil CR and my whole world has changed.  I'm not scared anymore and I feel a lot better.  I am optimistic, enthusiastic, outgoing, etc.  Paxil works for me.",9,30,1
"Paxil CR","Anonymous","March 29, 2008","-","I was taking Paxil for both depression and anxiety.  It worked very well for me for the past four years.  My husband could definitely tell the difference, and if I missed a dose, the effect was immediate.  However, I was not aware that it could cause weight gain, and I have gained over 40 pounds even though I am eating healthy and exercising.",7,45,1

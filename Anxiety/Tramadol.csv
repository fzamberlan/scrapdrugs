"Tramadol","K","May 31, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Maybe I’m the only person here with this reaction but tramadol makes me feel terrible. It gives me awful panic attacks and actually causes me anxiety. I am prescribed it for cervical herniations and I don’t even take it for that because of how much it makes my heart race and the debilitating panic attacks I have when I take it, I’d rather just be in pain. I really wish it worked for me.",1,4,1
"Tramadol","Harlan Thrimplestock","May 30, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Tramadol is a life saver. Like most I was prescribed it for pain and when I first took it I noticed I just felt a bit happier. NOTHING like a buzz, just a better mood. Time went on and I realized even taken early in the AM, it would keep me up at night. So I stopped. A couple of years later a friend mentioned he had it and my anxiety had been worsening so I figured I'd try it. Game changer. I take 2-3 (I'm a 190 lb male) and the difference it makes in my mood is incredible. I highly recommend this for people with anxiety and even depression.",10,3,1
"Tramadol","Skip","May 21, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been taking low doze transform for a long time for pain and klonopin for anxiety.   I can wake up with anxiety so bad I can't talk so now I asked my doc to up it.   He said,  and google it,  take tramadol with 2 Tylenol it ups it.   I don't know but it sure helps anxiety.  I hardly take it now.  I had to google to see that it does help people.. I'm not stopping!",7,4,1

"Tramadol","Bob","May 7, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Like many others I was initially prescribed this for pain but found its major benefit was in treating my longstanding anxiety. I have come off the SSRIs and only use 50mg Tramadol as required, Certainly not every day or even every week. I have no side effects and definitely no dependency. Given the amazingly positive reviews from anxiety sufferers I am very suspicious of the bad press this drug receives - it must not be a profitable one for the drug companies.",10,5,1
"Tramadol","Sticky","April 30, 2020","-","I never usually respond with comments but feel I must in this case as a duty to help others with anxiety. I realise there are different forms of anxiety? I too suffered anxiety for about 30 years.  I exercise regularly, run, cycle, meditate, gym work, eat all the recommended foods...all the right things. I have been on several serotonin medications which made symptoms worse, almost suicidal, until accustomed after a month.  But only partially successful. I had a new knee operation last year and took a Tramadol-Paracetamol combination for pain for a few weeks (37mg Tramadol per pill, 2, pills 3 times daily.  Also with the depression/anxiety meds. The anxiety totally disappeared. Now I am on  50mg Tramadol nightly, and no other medication, and I have felt so good for 3 months, and no negative side-effects.  I have a new life. I will think about trying 25mg (half tablet) daily My doctor is surprised, but is happy to prescribe based on my feedback !!",10,10,1
"Tramadol","Mikey","April 15, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been taking Tramadol for about 5 years now. I was initially taking it for shoulder pain from a fall. At the time I was taking clonezapam for anxiety along with the tramadol for pain. I no longer take the clonezapam. I take the tramadol for pain and anxiety, I take 50 millegrams and I have had no side effects, I can go days or even weeks without it. It works for me.",10,6,1
"Tramadol","Diego227","April 1, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Tramadol helped me tremendously to feel more present and thus less anxious. It is a good idea to expose people to tramadol in low to moderate dosage. Psychiatrists are under pressure to exclude it and are backed by research funded by pharma companies that recommend their drugs.  Where is the money, you ask? Nobody wants to hear about how tramadol helped your depression and or anxiety. Pharma doesn't send  your psychiatrist  to Maui to prescribe tramadol for your depression.  It is sad that such a powerful medication, not less habitual or addictive than the other stuff, is labeled as addictive, habit forming and plain dangerous. Those who know tramadol  (up to 100 mg a day, or just 50mg) will attest to its life changing qualities. Much less anxiety and much better spirits.",10,17,1
"Tramadol","Fox","February 16, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Tramadol does wonders to treat anxiety. If you do a search online you will find  stories of horrible side effects and withdrawal symptoms. But keep in mind that happens when taken way too much per day. I stick to 50-100mg per day",10,17,1

It helps with my pain, depression, anxiety as well . I’m allowed to take 100mg 3 times a day. I don’t notice the improvement until the second dose and it’s something I would have to have everyday. Drawbacks for me are constipation and insomnia.",9,36,1
"Tramadol","Sky","September 15, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Omg!! Wow! I started taking Tramadol for pain for my autoimmune condition and RA and I kept noticing that my pain was at a minimum. I USUALLY have a SEVERE case of anxiety and fatigue and probably a little depressed too. Welp, I started asking my family...WHY DO I FEEL SO GOOD? It is definitely a HUGE change for me but I couldn't figure out Why. Finally,I narrowed it down to Tramadol by not taking it for a day. I went right back to my feeling horrible self...so I took it the next day...and HOLY CRAP! My anxiety is low, I feel GOOD and I am sold! I will now gladly take this instead of suffering so badly. So thankful I realized this side effect. It has helped me so much!",10,60,1
"Tramadol","Makpaz","September 12, 2019","-","I previously rated Tramadol for depression (miracle) and now it time to rave about anxiety relief. I strongly believe psychiatrists are not paid to prescribe tramadol. They will tell you how addictive it is all while prescribing you psych meds with tenfold side effects. I find the mechanism of how Tramadol works fascinating. I see  no reason to shy away from 50mg daily. I find most people here forgetting to state how much they're taking.  Tramadol is a game changer. It may not work for some people based on their liver enzymes (connected to ancestry and hereditary). But hey you won't know till late you tried. A miracle medication with low addiction potential if you keep it on low dose  (50mg daily in my case).",10,42,1

In the past I have struggled with anxiety and depression , but since I've been taking tramadol, I've felt great. It really takes the edge off, and I would rather take tramadol than all the other meds rather I've been prescribed before for anxiety. I have no side effects with tramadol, and I'm worried about what I'm going to do when I run out.",10,33,1
"Tramadol","Aaron","August 3, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Again another med that has been deemed bad, at a very hard time in my life after loosing the love of my life.

"Tramadol","9ja","July 28, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Tramadol helped me in all my anxiety symptoms. I wanted to commit suicide on two different occasions, so I took tramadol to help with the pain but as soon as it gets effective in my body... I gave up on the suicide thoughts. Then, there was a time it got expensive to get and I couldn't get it I had suicide thoughts, and actually tried to, I ended up in the hospital I always looked back and wondered why I got so low but now  I realized it was the tramadol that worked its miracle on my moods and when I was without it I sunk into suicidal thoughts",9,29,1
"Tramadol","Tony","July 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","The fact of the matter is this Tramadol is a wonder drug  these so called drugs that are supposed to help you with your mental health are not cutting it. I'm a ex heroin addict in recovery and had a back surgery been on all kind of drugs for my mental health. Work with my psychiatrist on my head and have not found anything that helps like this. I'm aware that I could get a habit on this but so far so  good if you are a open book with everyone around you and keep it real this a very beneficial drug  This drug should be giving to help people in many ways .

"Tramadol","Bobby","May 15, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Similar to others here, I was prescribed Tramadol for back pain. It's decent for that, but really helps with my mood. My tablets are 50 mg which I cut into quarters.  I'll take one or possibly two of those quarters and it helps a lot. Try it, you might do fine by doing the same and it will extend your supply. The only side effect for me is difficulty reaching climax, so I try to limit how much I take.",7,24,1
"Tramadol","Tamarjit","April 25, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Was prescribed tramadol for chronic pain which was ruining my quality of life.  It not only helps with my pain but it genuinely lifted me out of the emotional pain I was living in.  I never take more than 150 mg per day.....most days 75 mg does the trick. A two for one drug!!!! It does cause constipation though. I have been taking tramadol for 5 years. I do not feel addicted and have not increased my dosage in that time. I take less than prescribed.",10,30,1

I feel so much more relaxed and my anxiety is gone. I will say it does make you tired but hard to sleep (at least for me)",10,19,1

"Tramadol","Tramadol saves lives","February 10, 2019","-","I was given tramadol for migraines. I realized after a couple of days that it completely took my severe panic attacks away. I struggle with depression, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and ADHD. Not only am I not having any anxiety when taking tramadol, it improved my suicidal tendencies and helped me become more clear, and a more productive person. I am able to face people, leave my comfort zone, complete tasks, and socialize more.  This drug is a miracle, and I am so thankful that I found it and that my PCP prescribes it for me. I’m hoping to God he never quits. Due to drug abusers, I’m sure it is difficult to get if your doctor does not believe in the medicine for depression and anxiety. Please conceded using for these reasons and get on board. Tramadol is saving lives.",10,73,1
"Tramadol","Pkp822","October 27, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I take tramadol for pain that I get in my right side. I take as needed, not everyday. How are you whom are taking it daily for anxiety able to get your dr to prescribe it for you? There’s been such a crackdown on these types of meds being prescribed, that I am really stumped how many of you are able to get it. I have to beg and dr gives me 10 at a time. I take for pain but notice my anxiety is better after taking it.",10,31,1
"Tramadol","Aminal","August 31, 2018","-","I took this medication for anxiety and depression and it worked miracles. Then I ran out of it and went through awful withdrawals. This drug is a narcotic with very addictive properties meaning it will very often lead to  drug-seeking  behavior. Heroin takes away depression but that doesn’t make it a good antidepressant because you need something long term that addresses the issue or you will end up worse off.  So yes, I took this and it helped my depression and anxiety but I had to always make sure it was available to me. A tolerance will build up fast and this medication has a dose limit to how much you can take a day because it increases the risk of seizures. You may not even take close to the top dose now and may never, but if you read this, haven’t genuinely tried several other legitimate options, and are concerned, ask your doctor why they prescribed this to you and ask if you can take it for anxiety or depression.",4,28,1

I took first dose of 50 mg. After 2 hours this medicines did miracle. It took away my anxiety, sad mood and I felt so happy. I took at 8 pm evening and its effects lasting next morning. I did not expect such positive results in just hours. I will continue this. However I have read that this is habit forming so I will take care not taking it daily. But antidepressants are also habit forming ,their withdrawal is also not very easy. But this medicine is too much effective with no side effects. I thank all the people here.

Like some other users, I've been on many antidepressants over the years but nothing really seemed to work so I'm off of all of the so-called FDA-approved meds. Tramadol isn't cheap ('cause I don't have a prescription and can't imagine getting one from my doctor for the reason I take it) but it IS cheaper than a visit to my psychiatrist.

I had energy and focus.  I was on this regimen for about 20 days.  About the third day into not taking Tramadol, I felt like hell!  Talked with PCP who pulled me off lexapro and now I take this.

If you take it for anxiety, make sure if asked that you say it is prescribed for pain as well. Several pharmacists tell me if you say it's for anxiety only, they have to report you and your MD and you both may be arrested. Not sure if the pharms are right, but if they are, it appears this is another case where a few abusers screw it up for the rest of us. It was not on the controlled substance list until very recently.

I was a daily drinker and since starting tramadol I have had nothing to drink , nor do I feel the need to go back to drinking for anything.

"Tramadol","Steady247","January 4, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Doctor prescribed as an alternative to narcotics for pain from herniated disk in neck. Doesn't eliminate pain, but makes it tolerable. Best thing is I am not in some narcotic fog and life can continue. I was also taking lexapro for some general anxiety.  Lexapro and Tramadol are not recommended together so with Dr. we decided to eliminate Lexapro. I was never a fan due to weight gain and if I missed a dose at night I would have uncomfortable sweating and head zingers. It wasn't fun for the first week without Lexapro due to withdrawal! Didn't expect the nausea, sweats, feeling of extreme heat, head fog...feeling much more balanced and steady, and reduced pain with just Tramadol!",10,51,3
"Tramadol","316","December 14, 2015","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I've tried over 15 drugs for anxiety/depression. This is the only medication that worked. It works instantly.  I wish it was prescribed long term for anxiety/depression. To avoid getting used to it and needing higher doses, I would take as need needed a few days a week. I think I used 100mg.",10,65,3
"Tramadol","Anxious_TOS_Sufferer","November 15, 2015","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I'm 32 yrs old and have been taking 50 mg of Tramadol HCL for pain associated with Thoracic Outlet Syndrome on and off for about a year now. Although it does lessen the pain, I've noticed that my brain is much more even keel after I've taken it. I have tried other anti-depressants and Xanax, but I don't like them because they make me feel like a zombie. This doesn't do that. It just clears away the anxiety fuzz, stops the attacks, and makes it so that I can actually function like a somewhat normal human again. I thought it was just me, but after seeing all of this, I know it's not. I'm going to have to talk to my doctor about it. I can't remember the last time I felt this normal. And there are NO withdrawal effects for a missed day.",10,65,3
"Tramadol","PorcaroJT","November 7, 2015","-","Tramadol was initially prescribed for pain. Didn't work at all to relieve my chronic headaches. But I noticed a lessening of stiffness from arthritis, as well as a more stable mood. Less anxiety.",10,52,3
"Tramadol","AddamNN","October 4, 2015","-","I am on a tramadol dosage of 150-200mg a day for abdominal pain. Been taking it for 2 months now. Little did I know this drug is also an antidepressant. I feel absolutely great when taking it.  It doesn't give you the same buzzed feel as a vicodin or percocet, however it puts you in a fantastic mood, relaxes you, and also works nicely on the pain without making you feel groggy or tired.  There are some dangers associated with the drug such as seizures, so please only take under the supervision of a doctor you trust. They will know if tramadol is safe for you to take.",9,71,3

"Tramadol","talari","September 23, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","When I was prescribed Tramadol for abdominal pain, little did I know about the Bonus effects. I was able to lose 20lbs in 3 months (less appetite).  My mood became so good and I got my joy of life back. I took 50mg daily. I felt less anxious and depressed. Mostly, I cared less about what people think of me. I started to swim and hike. My mom, who is against pills, said  you changed so much whatever that you do, keep doing it. I'm a 45 yo male.",10,93,3
"Tramadol","AnnaLou1","July 1, 2015","-","I was prescribed Tramadol 50 mg for headaches and TMJ pain.  However, the biggest difference this medication has made for me is the way it has helped my anxiety and depression.  It is truly amazing, and a blessing.  I have severe social anxiety but I find now that I can talk to people and actually want to socialize.  No other med has really ever helped me.  I truly wish that doctors understood how this medication helps those of us with long-standing anxiety and depression, it's a miracle.",9,121,3

I can't believe it but Tramadol actually works better for anxiety than all these benzos put together. I haven't taken my daily 4mg of klonopin but am feeling fantastic and very chilled on Tramadol. They should approve this stuff for both Anxiety and Depression, it's incredible.",10,129,3
"Tramadol","TramFan","April 2, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed Tramadol for kidney stones. Took 1 each day and gradually changed.  I stopped putting my head down when I left my apartment, trying to avoid eye contact with neighbors. I was actually smiling and stopping to say hello and people were now smiling back and waving. I did not have a knot in my stomach at the thought of riding the subway.  I was not cutting short my visits to clients only to return after hours and to work so I could avoid being around people.  I felt happy and I was not ready to fight with the first person that bumped into me on the street.  It was as if something in me was broken and Tramadol somehow fixed it.  All the bad things are back and I want more Tramadol but I can't get it. thinking of asking a Doctor.",10,86,3
"Tramadol","anonymous089","March 1, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","I was on this medication for about a week, after a minor surgery. I'm not sure how much it did for the pain, although I think it helped. But it REALLY helped with my anxiety. I usually have moderate anxiety, though I haven't gone to a doctor for it. I was also in the middle of a bad breakup and was feeling very on edge. When I took tramadol, it calmed me down and made me think quite clearly. I could think about things I was worried about but not be anxious about it. The heavy gut, on-edge feeling went away and I felt able to confront thoughts without them overwhelming me. It was really awesome! It made me very mildly sleepy sometimes, but not badly. I've taken xanax before and felt like that made me feel more out of it than tramadol did.",9,64,3
"Tramadol","JM316","February 14, 2015","-","I've tried over 13 medications for anxiety and none have worked not even the popular benzodiazepines. I tried 100mg of Tramadol and I felt the weight lifted from me. I felt like I could breath easier and relaxed.  It's the only thing that has worked. I'm looking for a doctor now who has experience with long term use or perhaps a doctor that can recommend a medication knowing that Tramadol works for me.",10,109,3
"Tramadol","JesseH","November 2, 2014","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I'm 20 and have a combination of anxiety, mild depression, and TMJ pain. For anxiety I tried Zoloft, Xanax, Klonopin, etc. Zoloft did nothing, and while the others worked, I couldn't use them long term. Tramadol is the miracle, road-runner medication. It covers all of my conditions and covers them great. It eases my jaw pain for 4-5 hrs and my mood/anxiety is pretty much nonexistant. I also have 0 side effects and don't find it addictive. Tramadol gave me my life back and will continue to! 10 star medication!",10,174,3
"Tramadol","Alex1109","October 25, 2014","Taken for 1 to 6 months","All I have to say about Tramadol is WOW. I'm 19 and have had mild depression associated with anxiety, as well as hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). I've tried Zoloft and Lexapro for my depression/anxiety, and also have used Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin) in the past. The antidepressants did nothing, and in fact made my symptoms worse. Although Xanax and Klonopin helped, they tended to make my moods shift up and down. Tramadol works AMAZINGLY for ALL of the above conditions! I take 50-100 mg and my mood is lifted, I feel steadily relaxed all day, focused, motivated. My underarm sweating is completely gone, and I feel like I'm getting my life back. it also works great for moderate pain. No side effects! It's a miracle medicine.",10,99,3

I have suffered from depression, fear of abandonment, and suicidal idiologies since I was a teenager. Last October I had a total left knee replacement. The surgeon put me on tramadol up to 8 a day. I never took that many but I did notice a change in my mood and depression. While not a panacea, tramadol (50mg) 2x a day has made a significant improvement in my symptoms especially since I am going through a breakup with my significant other.",7,85,3
"Tramadol","Working man","September 2, 2014","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Tramadol isn't too good for pain (although that's what it's indicated for), instead I find it to be a decent anxiolytic &amp; anti-depressant. To fully appreciate tramadol though you need to understand the medicine. The first 3 hours gives a 'mental lift', cheerful and fear-free, then, after that, tramadol's opioid metabolite takes over - rendering one very calm and (often) sleepy. It's at this 3-4 hour 'second stage' where you can sleep quite good on tramadol. But again, to summarize, you need to take tramadol for a couple days straight in order to fully appreciate the way it behaves. An acquired taste.",0,129,3
"Tramadol","Noxy","June 5, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","I was just recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was temporarily  prescribed tramadol for pain. I deal with terrible anxiety on a daily basis and it turns out since I've been taking this it has helped so much with anxiety. Although its been hard to concentrate while taking this I don't like the way it alters my mind but it's been a huge relief to be anxiety free. I havent discussed this with my doctor yet but so far I've found nothing else to help anxiety.",8,97,3
"Tramadol","Cam123456","February 11, 2014","-","Its hard to believe something like this can exist yet when you go to a doctor with cut up arms &amp; hearing voices, scared out of your mind, obsessed about an idea as irrational as the empty tight feeling in your chest they give you a box of antidepressants. I have always been socially awkward &amp; use to cry allot as a kid, the day dreamer who enjoyed being alone except I didn't like being alone. Tramadol gives me around 6 hours of bliss, 6 hours of clear thoughts of what is in-front of me, its amazing. a cure to unhappiness, its a shame its difficult to get, I have been on it for a year and a half, 1 50mg pill every 3 days gives me the motivation to wake up.",9,150,3

I have suffered with severe mood issues most of my adult life, and none of the many antidepressants I have tried did anything to help.  Within an hour of taking it, I felt normal for the first time in 15 years.  I talked to my physician, and she agreed to prescribe it off label to treat my mood disorder.

"Tramadol","Elocin X","July 9, 2013","-","I have tried EVERYTHING for my anxiety (my symptoms stem from post traumatic stress disorder, but have also been labeled as generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and social anxiety). Nothing has worked (aside from Benzodiazepines, which I avoid because of the sedative effect), other than Tramadol. I take 50mg a day. Recently I worried that I would run out so I tapered off of it- and my anxiety resurged with a vengeance. I never developed any tolerance for this medication- it has worked well for me for a year. The only negative has been when I mix it with alcohol. It didn't have much effect on the social anxiety but it worked great in general.",9,82,3

I've taken a benzodiazepine for countless years, which worked well for some of these things but not all. Over the years I tried many different supplement meds typically prescribed for these issues, but none worked or they had horrible side effects on me. So my doctor suggested Tramadol--I asked how this could even work (a pain medicine)? He explained its an off-label use of the medication but has found it very successful in other similar psychiatric patients and how he researched and explained how it chemically works in the brain (which I didn't really understand)...but IT WORKS AMAZINGLY!

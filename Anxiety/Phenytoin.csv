"Phenytoin","Frank20","March 25, 2010","-","<b>Dilantin (phenytoin):</b>			 My doctor prescribed Dilantin for anxiety and depression.  It seems to work just about 60 to 70% of the time for both conditions.  Other times I can't really tell the difference.  I use 1 or 2 - 100 mg Capsule(s) a day or only as needed.  I like that it is not habit forming and tolerance is not built up.  Side effects need to be looked at, although I don't experience any serious adverse effects.  Extra Vitamin B-12 and Folic Acid needs to be taken while taking Dilantin because it may cause a deficiency with these nutrients.",0,42,1

"Doxepin","QBaBoy","January 25, 2020","-","Today is day one- Took my first dose of Doxepin 25 mg last night. Woke up feeling very very depressed and VERY angry. I am ready to punch someone in the face and I haven’t even left my house yet today. I was just taking this for insomnia, but I am stopping this medication and calling my doctor because I can’t be cursing people out or punching them or being  angry for no reason. I screamed at and hung up on my boyfriend about an hour ago when he didn’t even do anything at all except interrupt me to remind me of something. Thank goodness he is understanding about what is going on and isn’t upset. Not to mention my thoughts are clustered and I only slept for 4 hours last night. So no, this stuff did not help me at all. It really messed me up. I’d rate this medication a NEGATIVE 10 if that were possible, but unfortunately this website makes me she was between 1 and 10 only, so I was forced to choose 1.",1,2,1

"Doxepin","Diana","November 11, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","A dermatologist put me on Doxepin because she thought my skin problems might be caused by anxiety. I took it at night; when I got up in the morning, I was so dizzy I had to hold on to walls and furniture to keep from falling! I felt kind of drunk all day; not good for people who have a job and/or other responsibilities. Oh well, my dermatological problems weren't caused by anxiety anyway. I gave this drug a 3 rating because it seems like it would be effective as a sleep aid and to reduce anxiety.",3,4,1
"Doxepin","Anon05","November 2, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Been on doxepin 10mg for insomnia and anxiety attacks. In only three days it has changed my quality of life for the better. I take it at 9pm, and I’m asleep by 10:30 or 11pm the latest. I sleep all night. I do feel a little groggy in the morning but it goes away after an hour of moving around. It keeps me centered and functional throughout the day. No anxiety, or panic. It has relieved my palpitations too. A bit of a dry mouth but my pharmacist suggested I drink water or suck on ice cubes. It relieves the dry mouth. I was put on sertraline 50mg and buspirone before this and that combo totally messed me up. They caused me mild serotonin syndrome (rapid heart rate and high blood pressure). I’m so glad my doctor put me on doxepin. It has helped so much! I will not touch sertraline or buspirone ever again.",9,17,1
"Doxepin","BrianB","June 8, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This drug doxepin has definitely decreased my anxiety and panic attacks. After years of trying nearly every drug out there, I've finally found one that works well (for me). The one downside I have with this drug is the grogginess in the mornings. However, I've been running in the morning to help ease the grogginess and it certainly helps.",8,15,1
"Doxepin","pcworkman","June 7, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Was on Doxepin many years ago, and did not have one anxiety attack or panic attack at night, when they mostly happened.  Then I went off it. Today, I am back on it, 25 mg at night.  I do not know why my doctor took me off it.  I am now back on it, so here's hoping.  Will let you know how things go.",10,10,1
"Doxepin","cyncyn","May 22, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I am just starting doxepin and so far anxiety is higher hoping it lessens. Will reevaluate in 2 weeks.",5,6,1
"Doxepin","Twiggy","May 7, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started doxepin for GAD eight weeks ago started on 50 mg and it took away all anxiety, and I felt like the old me. Now last two days I have all the bad thoughts and anxiety again.  Going to try to go up in dosage praying this helps...",9,11,1
"Doxepin","Anonymous","April 16, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started on doxepin 75 mg 15 days ago. I have notice a decrease in my anxiety, excitableness, and obsessive thinking and thoughts.  I use to have a problem sleeping. Not anymore!! I am asleep in about 20 min and I stay asleep. I use to be such a light sleeper, and never got more than 5 hours of sleep. I use to take Gabapentin for nerve pain. However, I haven’t needed it since taking Doxepin. I noticed it also takes my appetite away.  Now for the horrible side effects.....I have to force myself up. It takes me a few hours to fully be awake. I was in a horrible brain fog for the first 10 days. The first four days I felt like I had the flu. Now I am still dealing with the tiredness. I don’t want to stop it. However, I will if the tiredness doesn’t subside. I am glad I have had no headaches on the medicine, as other meds have given me.",8,18,1
"Doxepin","Bb","October 7, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I took this for anxiety and slept great, but the next day I kept having blood pressure drops and passed out while driving and had to call into work for the next two days to recover I was passing out from blood pressure drops over and over and having random anxiety attacks over and over for 24 hours. It was so so so horrible. I've never had blood pressure issues or passed out or anxiety to that level until I took this.",1,11,1
"Doxepin","Ht1990","August 10, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I started 10mg about 3 weeks ago for anxiety. It works but makes me extremely tired! I have two little ones at home and can't function well on it. I suggest taking it at home first to see how you feel. I don't drive when I take it especially with my children.",6,10,1
"Doxepin","Mary","April 27, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’ve been struggling with PTSD for well over 10 years. Incapacitating anxiety, insomnia, depression. I could no longer function at all. I’ve tried everything! Nothing worked unless it made it worse and gave me extremely bad side effects. It was so excruciating that I really wanted to throw in the towel. I started Doxepin about 6 or weeks ago. Then suddenly the intensity of my disorder severely decreased. Almost overnight and has continued to without any dips in its time. I’m absolutely stunned! I’m still on the low starting dose too. I’m overjoyed by relief. I’ve become myself again. I can actively participate in daily activities like showering, leaving my house, answering the phone, basic things that people take for granted. Before, I was totally immobilized. I hope this continues",10,39,1
"Doxepin","BBP007","December 2, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Started on Doxepin 100mg January 2017 due to debilitating GAD and panic attacks. I was miserable. Ten minutes after waking up, the panic attacks would start. I quit going out in public as much as possible. At night, I couldn't shut my mind off, which exasperated my insomnia. I was taking more Xanax than prescribed to try to get through the day. I specifically asked my psych for this based on reviews. Helped right away with sleep (with no next day grogginess for me), and after about a week, started putting the brakes on my anxiety. Slowly noticed I was getting parts of my life back. It served its purpose and pretty darn well, but in ten months I gained 30lbs and kept gaining.  Due to the ongoing weight gain I switched to gabapentin instead.",7,16,1
"Doxepin","nick-name","October 21, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Had to stop it because of the nightmares it produced. Tried dosages between 6-100mg. No matter what, I had terrifying nightmares when I went to sleep.",3,10,1
"Doxepin","righton2","October 10, 2017","-","I have suffered with severe anxiety and panic attacks, which manifested itself into not sleeping.  I literally stopped sleeping for several days.  Ended up in the ER a couple times and at the doctors all that week and finally had to be admitted to a mental health facility because nothing they were giving me was working.   I literally thought I was going to die.  After 9 days they finally found something that helped me sleep.   It was a combination of Doxepin 100mg, Xanax, Tramadol (which soon switched to Benadryl)  and Ambien.  These drugs gave me my life back and slowly restored my sleep cycle.  After a year or so I was weaned off the Ambien and then the Benadryl, so now I just take the Xanax &amp; Doxepin (now lowered to 50mg).  Amazing.",10,16,1
"Doxepin","stayinalive","September 28, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Honestly, a very good drug for anxiety and depression symptoms. The worse side effect is the weight gain. But in the end, for me personally, I would prefer relief from anxiety.",9,17,1
"Doxepin","No panic","September 24, 2017","-","Hi milemile I have been on doxepin many years for panic attacks before this medicine I stopped going out anywhere. You will be tired for a bit of time but it goes away . It stopped all panic attacks. Never had one panic attack for 10 years on this medicine. But I stopped to try other meds for higher mood.  But when I stopped doxepin the panic attacks returned so 10 years without panic attack on doxepin is a good thing!",9,18,1
"Doxepin","milemile","September 1, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","Hello, I was prescribed Doxepin for anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I took it last night and slept great but this am I could NOT open my eyes and all day I have been beyond drowsy even spaced out and exhausted.  I took 10 mg at bedtime last night.  I am going to try taking it at dinner time tonight around 7pm.  I am glad I slept great but I cannot function on this exhaustion.  Please tell me these side effects go away.  Also could one pill do all this.  Last night was first time I tried this:-(.  Thanks",0,16,1
"Doxepin","Anonymous","January 25, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I started doxepin last night and I have insomnia and wake up several times during the night. I slept from 6:30pm til 7:30am, but still a little tired today, but I didn't wake up once. So, so far so good. I think I'm going to be very pleased with this drug. It also helped a lot with my anxiety as well. I've had zero side effects so far and hopefully won't have any. Good luck to everyone that takes it cuz for me after trying several meds, this seems to be the best one so far and without weight gain too. Most insomnia medication causes weight gain from the research I've done and this one doesn't thank god because I've just lost 110lbs and do not want to put any weight on now that I'm at my perfect weight size for my height. I hope this helps.",10,41,1
"Doxepin","metalman1980","September 17, 2016","-","This drug was terrible, I would take it at night and fall right to sleep and when I get up in the morning im completely exhausted and dizzy. My balance is off and feel like im in a daze. I was extremely irritable. The entire day I was depressed and in a very very bad mood. Everything bothered me. My anxiety was terrible. Tremors in my hands and just feeling kind of loopy. Nightmares when sleeping. This drug did nothing of any benefit for me. I was taking it to help with my social anxiety and panic attacks.",2,30,1
"Doxepin","Gotribein16","March 20, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was experiencing very bad anxiety and was having panic attacks nearly everyday. I also had issues sleeping, I couldn't sleep more than 2 hours at a time. My doctor put me on 75mg once daily at bedtime. I feel like my old self. I am sleeping very well at night and I haven't had a panic attack in 8 months. Doxepin gave me my life back.",10,59,1
"Doxepin","fayfaith","November 20, 2015","-","<b>Sinequan (doxepin):</b>			 If you're not able to take or no longer able to take SSRI'S, SNRI'S &amp; Benz's this is a drug to consider.  I've taken it off an on for decades. It helps tremendously in maintaining a normalcy n excellent for someone deprived of sleep. Takes time,but once adjusted it will become less of problem.Although it will continue to help for a good night's sleep. It's best to take this medication later in afternoon, until you do adjust.

"Doxepin","DKT26","May 17, 2015","-","Been on many SSRIs, a few SNRIs, and some of the TCAs. I took Tofranil (imipramine) for about 6 months on a starting dose of 25 mg and eventually increased slowly to 125mg. Over the course of those 6 months, my anxiety was under control for the most part, but I developed myoclonus and had to stop taking the drug. I switched to Sinequan (doxepin) 25 mg, increased to 75 mg, divided into 25mg three times a day and have done well, without any side effects besides mild fatigue. No bad thoughts, lingering anxiety or panic attacks. Very successful drug (doxepin) for me so far. Been about 3 months now.",9,64,1
"Doxepin","KellyBird57","February 24, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","Especially good for helping you stay asleep!  The problem is that I slept 12 hours straight and most of the next day.  I didn't really have an issue staying asleep before- my issue is more with relaxing/ going to sleep at appropriate times.  So, if you have a lot of trouble staying asleep, this definitely works.  No terrible side effects, was just very sleepy.  If you really need the sleep, go for it!",5,53,1
"Doxepin","Buffs","June 23, 2014","-","My Dr. Prescribed me Doxepin 10mg. For depression, anxiety, and insomnia. So far so good, calms me down wonderfully when my three kids or my husband cause me to have an anxiety attack, and is working well with my depression. Only things it isn't doing to much for my insomnia I still go to bed at about 9pm and fall asleep around  2:30-3:00am. I have also taken Lexapro which worsened my depression, Zoloft just made me feel like a  zombie or like I was wired out of my mind, and Prozac which worked great on me but since I have insomnia my Dr. gave me Doxepin.",6,35,2

"Doxepin","speedy501","February 11, 2014","-","Yes, Doxepin mixed with Zanax is a nightmare. Too many adverse reactions......increased anxiety, severe agitation and frustration. It's like nothing can go quick enough for you.",0,34,2
"Doxepin","Nickynickname","June 8, 2013","-","Psych keeps trying to replace Klonopin and Ambien with doxepin. It is very dose dependent. Prescribed 50mg but take 10mg, splitting capsules.  Great sleep helps with anxiety next day but sedating. Non habit forming - no real good feeling.  Took last night worked great for sleep and anxiety.  Will see how today goes.",7,57,2
"Doxepin","Anonymous","May 2, 2010","-","I have been taking Doxepin for 26 years to treat depression and acute anxiety. It has worked well and enabled me to feel normal and lead a normal life. Recently though it has stopped working as well and I am having panic attacks and anxiety again. I think I have become immune to to it because of taking it for so long. Would like to switch to a newer drug but my doctor is not keen to swap me.",0,55,2

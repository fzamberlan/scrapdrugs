I had certain  events that I had to go through that raised my blood pressure to very high levels. Venlafaxine helped to sleep really well at its maximum dosage of 150 mg to 9-10 hours. After almost a week, my BP started to drop. My doctor gradually reduced the dosage  by 25% and my BP returned to normal. I would highly recommend it to anyone to talk to their doctor. Its cost is almost too low to mention. Monthly bill about 15-20 Canadian dollars. 70% comes back from insurance.",9,4,1

I began taking Effexor XR when I began having panic attacks while driving. I began with 37.5mg for 4 weeks, then upped to 75mg after that. After 3 months, I began to sweat in my sleep despite not feeling overheated. I began to suffer from sexual dysfunction, lost my libido and had difficulty reaching an orgasm (neither had been an issue previously). My appetite increased and I gained 25lbs in 1 year. I also noticed I felt very flat emotionally. I wrote this because I feel like positive reviews are lacking. Effexor absolutely improved my anxiety. The side effects were unpleasant but not severe. Stopping this medication suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms, so when I switched to a new one, I slowly tapered off it by opening the capsule and counting the granules, reducing them by about 4 per day.

It came on the night after my last dose with a spasm in my chest and neck, I went to the ER immediately for fear of Seratonin Syndrome. This spasming spread to my entire body after about 3-4 hours. It was one of the scariest times of my life (and I been through it all!). They eventually gave me a low dose and shot me up with benzos and I stopped convulsing after 15-20 mins. After dealing with the ridiculous side effects- brain zaps, a swishing sound in my head when I moved my eyes to quickly to the right or left, twitching, feverish cold sweats from withdrawal if I missed a dose, etc. Next day they put me on a low dose of Prozac-20mg, which stopped the withdrawal symptoms and is commonly used for this exact situation.

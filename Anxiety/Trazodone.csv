"Trazodone","Momma90","May 23, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I got on trazodone just recently literally  Day 3 at half a pill I will begin a full  pill this weekend. I am on it for anxiety, depression, and lack of SLEEP !! Well, it has kept me WIDE AWAKE &amp; miserable. I work 12 hour shifts almost DAILY so when I get off and tend to the home I wanna SLEEP, so I took this pill it did NOT help or MAKE ME SLEEP !! So disappointed !!  My dr said it’s not normal for it to make you stay awake considering what’s in it to help you sleep !!! Calling dr back and I am going to STOP IT ASAP, while I can.  - sincerely sleepy PARENT",1,4,1
"Trazodone","Greg","May 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have mixed feeling about trazadone.  It helped me a lot, and at that time it was a life saver for me. My insomnia, anxiety, depression just disappeared completely. Before that I had suicidal thoughts, I couldn't get out of the bed, I had social anxiety, panic attacks, but after trazadone I was already a functioning, happy human being. I started to go out with my friends again, I had motivation etc. So far so good BUT it had too many side effects... I needed to sleep like 10-11 hours, I was numb for hours after awakeing, I felt constant dizziness, my sex drive disappeared. And the withdrawal was tough... I had to reduce the amount very slowly. So basically nothing seriously bad, and it is still a decent antidepressant, but there are better SSRIs out there. It will sure help your depression/anxiety, but you will have to pay the price for that (that is true for every medicine btw)",7,7,1
"Trazodone","LUCY","March 31, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been using Nuzak for many years, started gaining weight and experienced some hair loss  so my Dr prescribed Trazodone 50mg (30).  I took my first pill last night before 8pm. Within 20 min's after taking the pill I started feeling a tingling sensation in my fingers, legs and feet. I looked at my husband and said there is something wrong with me.  I then literally collapsed on the floor. HUBBY said I was unconscious for almost 10 min's . He explained that I felt cold and looked very pale and the weight of my body felt double than normal as he was trying to lift me up.  Eventually I gasped for air and immediately started to vomit. I remember I felt weak and vulnerable (worst feeling ever)!",1,13,1

I went to my doctor suffering from insomnia due to night sweats from mid-life body changes but also from anxiety. Hormonal imbalances affect sleep. No fun but  it is what it is. I was prescribed trazadone and take 50 mg 2 weeks during the month and I sleep like a baby. I do get dry mouth but an easy side effect to live with. The first night I took it my heart beat a bit weird but did not the 2nd night on. Additionally it has dialled down my anxiety and depression to barely noticeable levels. I think if it as Diet Lexapro.",10,19,1

"Trazodone","DeeZee","December 12, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I started taking Trazodone as my anxiety was so bad it was keeping me from sleeping. I started small, taking only half of the 50mg pill, and worked my way up to a level I now take every night. I never exceed one and a half pills though, I found that if I take too much waking up the next morning is rough and I feel like a zombie. But all in all my sleep schedule has been regular since I started taking Trazodone. There are even some nights where I don't have to take it at all, especially since starting therapy. I enjoy the fact that Trazodone isn't addictive.",9,21,1

However, the 100 mg tablet of trazodone that I take nightly to help me sleep is a godsend! It stops my racing thoughts and feelings of panic. And now I sleep between six and seven hours per night. Such a relief. I hope it can help you too. By the way, I do get dry mouth. For myself, I feel it is a small price to pay for peace and rest.

"Trazodone","Anonymous","October 7, 2019","-","13 years ago, I was prescribed 100 mg at bedtime for insomnia and anxiety. Upon Awakening, I couldn't think straight. It was awful. So I discontinued it. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to request that my doctor prescribed trazodone again a 25 mg per night. I am a long time user of benzodiazepines. Doctors are reluctant to prescribe benzos. Quite frankly, I'm tired of the battle to get them. Not only that. My favorite is Xanax. Xanax is a brain cell Destroyer. I would like to keep what's left of my mind. The trazodone 25 mg at bedtime allows me to sleep through the night without anxiety and flashbacks . No lying awake tossing and turning reliving undesirable events in my history. My insomnia has been a lifelong condition. I have mostly self-medicated through the years. My Hope Is that I have found the right treatment at the right dosage. If they beneficial effects continue to last, I will stick with this.",10,36,1

It also had the issue of making me feel sleepy, but I could only sleep an hour then I couldn’t go back to sleep, the next day I would feel completely zombified and struggle to even move or do anything. It increases my heart rate a lot and doesn’t mix well with my ADHD medication.",1,19,1

When I woke up my anxiety was 10 x worse I was scared my depression increased. Daily life activities stopped for months I became scared of living or taking care of my child. I had extremely bad brain fog, dry mouth, sleep terrors nightmares that would last hours, heart palpitations, but the worst feeling of all was the increased anxiety the feeling that I had some underlying medical condition that the Dr. Couldn't find, dizziness, shortness of breath, and suicidal thoughts feeling like I would never get better.

"Trazodone","Krissy","May 13, 2018","-","I started taking 50 mg at night for sleep. I was told that for anxiety/ depression, the therapeutic dose is much higher. I disagree- I have noticed a difference, not just in my sleep, but in the way I think about things- more logically. Last night, I started to have extreme anxiety/ paranoia. I decided to take my dose early so I would  be knocked out, ending the thoughts. It didn't knock me out- maybe it was too early to take it, or maybe I was too anxious. But it did help me calm down, think rationally, and I was able to focus more. I think it's great, If I'm tired and can't sleep, it knocks me out. If I don't need sleep and I'm getting anxiety, it calms me down and helps me think clearly- not like I'm high from from a benzo. I think this is a good med to try in different situations and see what / how/ when it works. Only bad thing: I skipped it one night, thinking because I had to be up earlier, I would be tired the next day. I had like a rebound effect- I was up  ALL night..",8,40,2

I had tingly sensations in my neck chest and arms. I was wide awake until 4am and completely panicked and scared. I’ve been on tons of medications and never had this type of reaction.

I have PTSD, trouble falling/staying asleep, and anxiety/panic during the day. I take between 12.5mg and 25mg of trazodone at night. It’s like a miracle drug for me. The side effects I’ve had are feeling a little zoned out (this has worn off over the past 3 weeks), less nervous eating, and occasional increased REM sleep. It’s important to take it early (by 10pm) otherwise I can feel groggy for many hours during the day. But it’s made my anxiety VERY manageable. I definitely wasn’t expecting it to work. There are no withdrawals or unpleasant side effects if I don’t take it. It works just as well as ativan or Xanax with fewer side effects (I don’t feel loopy). Very happy!!!",10,62,2

She is happy, has lots of friends and is getting good grades in school. She has a tougher skin and a maturity I never thought would come.   This medication and a lot of love saved this girl.

The Dr then put me on 50mg trazodone which so far I have only been using for 2 weeks. So far for me personally it hasn't worked any sort of wonders, the only way I can describe It is that I don't feel so much all over the place if that makes sense and unfortunately it hasn't helped with my sleep at all.

The negatives far outweighed any benefits though. Within the first week I had lost my appetite and when I ate I would just bloat. I also got stomach pains. It basically shut my metabolism down. I have extreme headaches and dizziness as well and zero motivation. I have to say that I am one of those people that are very sensitive to medications so this drug may benefit some people",3,19,2

Worst thing for me was a rare side effect that caused my bone marrow to stop producing white blood cells. A swollen lymph node resulted in a blood test, which showed no wbc's at all. Scared of cancer, but my doc told me to stop taking this drug and the tests afterward were back to normal. I suggest you get blood tests if on this med.",9,91,2

Initial dose was 150 mg so right away I cut it down to 75mg. I still had side effects such as tremors in the morning for a couple of hours and stopped taking it.

I had to quit taking my klonopin due to being pregnant and I thought I might end my life due to the panic attacks and constant dread. Surprisingly, trazedone during the day replaced the klonopin very well and didn't make me so tired to where I couldn't function like I was worried it might. It slowed my negative responses down and my heart rate down to where I wasn't in panic mode and it's without the more impulsive side effect some of the benzos can give you.

I even feel confident that things will work out! And I sleep thorugh the night....I rarely have trouble falling asleep, so what I usually do is go to sleep &amp; when I wake up in the night and can't back to sleep, take it then. This works like a charm for me. The only side-effects seem to be occasional dizziness.....Trazodone is WAY better than Elavil (HORRIBLE drug) and Lorazepam which kept me spaced out and unable to remember anything.",10,105,3

It would some what relax me, I'd fall asleep, but suddenly, I was awoke after about 3 hrs .  After communicating that, I was told that because of my weight gain now weighing 198, height (5'3)  that contributed to the non effectiveness, and the fact that on the end of my treatment, I was no longer taking some of the other meds.

For insomnia, this is the ONLY drug that manages to knock me out for about 8 or 9 hours straight, but when you wake up the next morning, prepare to feel groggy and disoriented for at least 5 hours the next day, which is way to long to feel this way, IMHO. For anxiety, you don't feel ANY anxiety while on this drug, but that's because this drug makes you so  groggy and tired that you can't really think of anything while on this drug.

Though I mastered recognition of severe anxiety and can skip the ER realizing I cannot die from a panic attack, the effects would still bring me physically to my knees. I failed to respect the source of anxiety: depression. However, the SSRIs out today like Zoloft, etc, are bad on your brain and totally destroy your libido. You eventually are robbed of sleep and the problems spiral: blood pressure, obesity, apnea. Trazadone solves both problems for me, mental depression, physical insomnia.

It helped me a lot with the anxiety (it calmed me down) and also it improved considerably my sleep at night. Although the sedating activity is immediate, the anxyolytic activity takes some time to show effect and requires increasing dose. I have noticed no major side effects, except from orthostatic hypotension and some headaches mainly at the beginning of the treatment. It works well as a sleep aid, but care must be taken when you increase the dose (should be done gradually increasing the dose by 25 mg). The dose of 100 mg at bedtime works fine for me.

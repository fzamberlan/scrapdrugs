"Prochlorperazine","Sally","June 10, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was given this medication prochlorperazine yesterday afternoon through IV. Supposedly for nausea I didn't even have. About 10 mins after the drip finished I started getting anxious, got home couldn't sleep as my legs were so stiff and I felt so restless. Now all this morning I'm all jittery and my head feels awful like it's working overtime and my anxiety is unbearable. Anyone know how to flush this out of my system cause I can't cope and I'm struggling to get my kids organised, and luckily I took the rest of the week off work cause I would not cope.",1,0,1

At one point while admitted in the hospital, I was given Compazine intravenously to alleviate my nausea symptoms. After about 10 minutes or so, I started to experience a SEVERE panic attack. I was convulsing, I started to rip out my hair, and I no longer could speak words. Therefore I wasn't able to properly tell the nurse what was wrong with me. The physical sensations of panic and the illogical thought process I was experiencing were so powerful, that for a moment I considered taking my own life, just to make it stop. I endured this feeling for more than 15 minutes before the night Doctor was able to arrive and properly sedate me. That was one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life.. I literally wanted my life to be over.",0,10,1
"Prochlorperazine","Robert","February 3, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Compazine (prochlorperazine):</b>			 Just got out of the ER with my daughter. She got the migraine cocktail with Compazine as well. She became irritable at the hospital and just wanted to leave. They finally discharged her and she started feeling nauseous on way home. Has been vomiting for an hour now and full of anxiety. She's begging for it to just stop. Nothing online for a counter agent. I am  annoyed because my wife mentioned the drug gave her lock jaw as a child but the Dr said drug allergies/reactions are not hereditary. And he also never mentioned any side effects until we got home and called back to find out if she needed to return. It may work for some people but be wary. My family is no longer taking it.

Mind you this was given as treatment for severe migraine and one week before a 7 day cruise. 24hrs later, I was back in urgent care with slurred speech. Thought I was having a STROKE. Delayed allergic reaction that had to be reversed with benadryl via IV.  I swear, I hope to NEVER come across another medication with side effects like compazine.

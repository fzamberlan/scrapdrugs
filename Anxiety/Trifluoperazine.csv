"Trifluoperazine","NJ-Bob","November 11, 2014","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I took this about 45 years ago in my 20's, for several years for anxiety, when it was called Stelazine. Now it is only available as the generic trifluoperazine. I've had a prostate and bladder condition for s few years now and often suffer nocturia, needing to go every 20 minutes once I go to bed at night. This often can last the entire night until 8AM-9AM. In desparation I tried this drug again and found that 1mg quiets my bladder within an hour and lets me sleep. Even if I do get up every hour or two, I can get back to sleep. Other overactive bladder meds have unacceptable side effects on me of dry mouth, and greatly lowered BP. This has no side effects, calms me down, reduces the frequency about 75% and lets me sleep.",9,6,1

"Trifluoperazine","Anonymous","August 6, 2011","-","<b>Stelazine (trifluoperazine):</b>			 I take 1mg/daily. So far it is very effective, I tend to be able to be more relaxed and can sleep with clear and peaceful thoughts where I used to be laying in bed 20 minutes thinking too much.  But seems not to do much for my social anxiety. Overall, pretty effective.",0,37,1

"Amitriptyline/chlordiazepoxide","Anonymous","April 10, 2011","-","<b>Limbitrol DS (amitriptyline / chlordiazepoxide):</b>			 I tried all sorts of SSRI's with no effect. I tried this medicine and after about a month I began to feel a lot better. I take this with 5mg of Valium whenever I have panic attacks. The only side effect I had was a slightly unpleasant taste in my mouth. It can be a bit annoying, but I suffer so much from anxiety, a little bad taste in my mouth is not too much to deal with. I would recommend this to anyone who has tried many medications with no results, and really need relief from their severe anxiety.",0,20,1

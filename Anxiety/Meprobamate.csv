"Meprobamate","Shorty","May 12, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","We had a collie that was scared out of his mind by fireworks and thunder; our veterinarian prescribed meprobamate for him and it worked better than anything we had tried previously.  Collies seem to be very sensitive to these kinds of drugs and it takes longer for them to clear their system but with meprobamate he was up and back at it the very next morning.",8,1,1
"Meprobamate","Flutter","March 27, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I'm really liking Meprobamate so far, it works better than any benzodiazepine I've ever been prescribed for anxiety. It really helps to relieve my anxiety as well as my tension, nervousness and calm my racing thoughts. I honestly feel like I'm finally able to really relax and enjoy life for the first time in years and without being drowsy, as where with benzodiazepines they would take away my anxiety, but I still had all the tension, mind racing 100 miles a minute and half the time I was just really sedated. The Meprobamate does so much more and without any sedation.",10,6,1
"Meprobamate","Tim","December 21, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Over the years my physician has literally tried every benzo in existence for my extremely severe anxiety and now that I'm on meprobamate it really works better than any benzo I've been on.  I whole heatedly give it a 10",10,7,1
"Meprobamate","Cole","September 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","<b>Miltown (meprobamate):</b>			 I have finally found a Dr to approve this med only to find the price is up there and needs preauthorization. I used this when I was younger. I absolutely thought I was going crazy had no idea what was wrong with me and when I took it they worked now I am hoping to have that same result as in the past. A calm state is a godsend.",0,3,1
"Meprobamate","Ajay","January 25, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Miltown (meprobamate):</b>			 yes it is effective and is a lot different from Valium, Xanax or Tranxene.  I found it to be a more gentle calm. If you are taking this at  a high dose......God help you if you run out.  Awful  awful withdrawal symptoms until you get another refill.  With benzos I never had any trouble when I stopped taking them. But everyone is different.",0,7,1
"Meprobamate","LH","November 10, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","This drug works amazing for anxiety. I was prescribed this due to adverse effects I have had with benzodiazapines and this works way better at calming me down. The only thing is it makes me really tired. It's not really ideal for someone trying to deal with test anxiety because I do feel like it sedates me a little bit too much to function. However I may try it before sleep and see how it works.",8,4,1
"Meprobamate","MrsMackBee","November 18, 2015","Taken for 10 years or more","my husband took meprobamates for about 30 years, he has been called bipolar schitzoaffective disorder ptsd manic depressive take a guess, seems every Dr has a different opinion. He did fairly well on this along with Paxil and Wellbutrin, but one Dr changed him to Klonapin (along with several other meds) and he has been on various doses of Klonapin for the last 5 or 6 years, now Dr swapped Lexapro for the Paxil and decreased the Wellbutrin and he is about jumping out of his skin. Oh how I wish we could find a Dr that would put him back on the meprobamates, he did so much better on those. I do not understand their reluctance, extremely hard to find a psychiatrist in our area especially one who will take new patients or geriatric patients.",8,16,1
"Meprobamate","wyliesmom","December 17, 2014","-","<b>Miltown (meprobamate):</b>			 Great medicine for my panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia.  It is very calming for me and not too strong.  I can't tolerate many medicines, and this is the only one that does not back fire on me and give me worse problems than I started with.  It may be the oldest of it's type, but for me...it is the very best and for me, the safest with no side effects.",0,35,1
"Meprobamate","LB40","November 10, 2013","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Miltown (meprobamate):</b>			 Benzodiazepines, are way better. Valium or clonazepam have a VERY long half life.(last about 18-24hours) This medicines work great for me, for overall Anxiety. In my case Xanax is the only drug that helps with my Panic Attacks. It works the fastest. And that is very important, when you have a bad event,   like Panic Attacks. Not Anxiety attacks, there is a big difference. Panic is a Event(Can last awhile).These can give you aftershocks after the initial event and initial dose of Xanax. Anxiety attacks don't last long, and are not near as bad. Panic Attacks can be up to 10 times worse, than anxiety attacks. No triggers needed for Panic, in my case. Anxiety attacks usually center around  stress, difficult situations, etc.",0,11,1
"Meprobamate","Anonymous","July 5, 2013","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been taking 1600 mg for 35 years. It is the only medicine that my doctor tried that really worked to relieve my panic disorder. However, it is only currently being produced by one drug company, and they are really expensive. It is considered an old fashioned medicine. Right now my insurance is covering it with a $50 copay. I don't know of any other medicine that is similar, so I guess I'm stuck for now.",10,21,1
"Meprobamate","Randolpho90210","March 8, 2011","-","Helps immensly. I have taken three 400mg every day for 30 years and never increased my dose. Often, I forget to take it and never had withdrawal.",10,41,1
"Meprobamate","raraider","February 17, 2011","-","<b>Miltown (meprobamate):</b>			 I have chronic panic disorder with agoraphobia and due to the fact I have not responded to any antidepressant and have only had a moderate response with benzodiazepines (I was taking Xanax XR) I spoke to my doctor about trying Miltown (meprobamate), the first anxiolytic in history, just to see if it can help. I take 400 mg four times a day (1,600 mg) and I have, to my surprise, actually found it to be fairly effective. I was particularly surprised due to its low potency, 0.5 mg of Xanax is considered bioequivalent to 1,400 mg of Miltown. It takes longer than Xanax, Ativan, or Valium to work and I have noticed I can feel when Miltown starts to work where as I did not with benzodiazepines (bad). Good novel treatment.",0,65,1

This is the best advise I can give someone thinking about taking this Medication. Currently I am on 2mg, I take it for major depression. My Dr started me off on 1mg. It seems like I had side efforts from the drug in the beginning. Dry mouth, weight gain, irritable and fatigue. So I started taking it at night. After about 2 weeks I then switched to morning again. Side efforts went away except for me eating :(. Overall its a good drug if it helps. I would recommend it. DOWNSIDE: do not just stop taking the drug! You most taper down on the medication. You will have effects if you just stop taking it. For example MOODY as heck. Then it takes a few days to build the medicine back up in your body for it to go away.",0,4,1

I was put on zoloft for a long time - maybe 3 years, so I started when I was 15 years old which  was when I was diagnosed with depression. 3 years went by and I started getting worse and worse. They misdiagnosed me - I really had bipolar disorder so they then took me off the Zoloft cold turkey. Then they put me on Latuda and Lamictal. Latuda made me throw up 30 minutes after taking it, plus it didn't work. The lamictal did help my mood though,  so they took me off Latuda. I felt so hopeless. That was until about a month and a half ago, when I was put on Rexulti and within a day of taking it, I felt so much better. No joke, this Rexulti is a miracle drug, everything has been so much better. It helps me feel balanced and I don't have severe episodes. It really calmed me down and made me happier. My only complaint is that I had a big appetite within the first two days of taking it. To those searching for a prescription that works- PLEASE at least TRY rexulti.",0,59,1

I  was getting up in the middle of the night to eat. I  have never had this behavior before and I'm in my 40's. In the past, if I began gaining weight,  I  immediately talked to the doctor and had my medication  switched.  However,  this time,  I was conflicted.  The way I felt taking Rexulti felt like a miracle and I hated the idea of quitting,  until.....I gained  70lbs!! I even gained  20 lbs in 3 days. I finally felt I had no choice but to stop Rexulti. I've been miserable for almost two years now.  I've recently lost 23 lbs, but it has been so difficult.  If I could go back, I would have switched after the first 10 lbs!!

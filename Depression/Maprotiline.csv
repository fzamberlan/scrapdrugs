"Maprotiline","Pookie","May 12, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","Just wondering if anyone has found a place that has maprotilene. I was getting from Canada but it came from Turkey and now it cannot be mailed from there because of the virus.",10,3,1
"Maprotiline","Bobc","January 24, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been using Maprotoline  for many years. I’ve tried every antidepressant and it is the only one that works. I too am having trouble getting it and I’m very concerned. I’ve seen that some people are getting this from Canadian Pharmacies. Can anyone share the names of any such pharmacies? Help!",10,3,1
"Maprotiline","Pookie","December 6, 2019","-","I have been taking this drug maprotiline for depression for 30 years and I feel very safe taking it and no real side effects. Problem is it is back ordered and I had a hard time finding any of it except for Canada.  The manufacturers says it will come back in February or May.  I am not sure that will happen. My question did anyone transfer to a different drug and what was its name and how are they feeling.  I am very upset that they will not continue to make maprotoline.",10,3,1
"Maprotiline","Anonymous","July 23, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","maprotiline has been extremely effective for  me for over 35 years. I have had difficulty getting it for the last 12 months and now just learned the name brand Ludiomil is still available through Canadian Pharmacies",10,8,1
"Maprotiline","balticwolf","February 10, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Ludiomil (maprotiline):</b>			 I tried Ludiomil over thirty years ago when I was severely depressed.  Of all the different antidepressants that had been prescribed for me (amitriptyline, doxepin nortriptyline, desipramine, trazadone, etc.) Ludiomil was definitely the most effective of the ones I tried. Unfortunately, it like Remeron (which I tried years later) raised my liver enzymes and I was told by my physician (I was seeing a psychiatrist at the time) to discontinue using it. But I was lucky: just before I was scheduled to undergo electro-shock therapy to cure my intractable depression, I learned that I was allergic to the milk protein and after removing it from my diet I never again had the deep melancholy I had experienced before.",0,13,1
"Maprotiline","Souled on it","May 19, 2015","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been taking maprotiline for over 35 years and I am still taking it (there seemed to be a shortage for a while about 2 years ago but Walgreens still carries it). I started having panic attacks with the onset of my allergy to dust mites when I was a teenager. In my 20's, I went into a deep depression and couldn't sleep for 3 months. I started taking maprotiline and 3 improvements occurred: 1) My depression subsided and then went away. 2) My panic attacks stopped. 3) The almost daily sneezing episodes associated with my allergy subsided, and now, they occur maybe twice and month. My runny sinuses also dried up considerably. I twice tried taking myself off of the medication--it didn't work. All problems returned after about 10 days.",9,15,1
"Maprotiline","Dottie122","February 3, 2014","-","<b>Ludiomil (maprotiline):</b>			 I had been on Ludiomil for over 30 yrs and they discontinued it. I went on the generic maprotiline and now there going to stop it to. I'm beside myself. I have about another month and I will be out.  This medicine saved my life, I can't believe they could just stop making it for those of us on it. They say it is not addictive, but let me tell you I have tried several times to get off of it and I get all the same symptoms I had over 30 years ago on top of the withdrawal symptom I'm going to get. Life is about to go bad again. The doctor and I talked he says he won't mix maprotiline with any other medicine and I'll have to be off it for 2 weeks and before starting another medicine. This will put me into a severe depression. Nothing else works.",0,29,1
"Maprotiline","Map User","February 27, 2009","-","I've been using Maprotiline for ten years. I think it's the best antidepressant out there but since it's not new it's not being prescribed.",10,26,1

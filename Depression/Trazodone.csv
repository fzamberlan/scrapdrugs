"Trazodone","Island Girl","June 4, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","My doctor prescribed this since Prozac and brintellix wiped me out sexually. Apart from the issue with libido, Prozac suited me perfectly, not so however this drug Trazodone. I was told to take 150mg..which in the light of these reviews seems extreme considering my sensitivity to drugs and my body weight, being petite. As instructed I took it five hours before bedtime. I then slept like a zombie for ten hours and woke feeling groggy with super spaced out eyes the next morning. I felt heavy, drugged and seemed to have lost my sense of balance. It took till lunchtime to feel vaguely normal again. While I do not doubt this would prevent the panic attacks as you would be too out of it to panic, whatever the issue, nuclear attack, invasion of the body snatchers, aliens abducting your children. I had no intention of suffering such extreme side effects. Consequently, I did not take again. The search goes on for the perfect drug. It most definitely is not this one.",0,3,1
"Trazodone","Shaggin","May 15, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been taking trazadone for many years for depression, anxiety and it also helps to minimize or eliminate thought disturbances and of course it helps you sleep. So this medication does a lot and overall I will say that it has been working for me. However I do not like taking this med as it sedates you so much its hard to wake up out of it. This is the one medication I wish I could wean myself off of. Sometimes I skip a dose or two but cannot get too far from it as I will start having symptoms of depression and anxiety again. So I'm pretty much dependent on it.",7,8,1
"Trazodone","Cat","April 30, 2020","-","Doc prescribed me Trazodone for Depression. I started with 25mg because I react very sensitive to meds and the first night I had arrythmia, anxiety, cold sweat and insomnia. These side effects disappeared after 2 weeks except for occasional arrythmia. I slept well in the beginning, but I was also extremely tired during the day. I felt a bit more emotionally stable so I started taking 50mg which was a horrible decision. I had severe sexual dysfunction, wasn't able to feel anything during sex, I slept all day, felt extremely weak, my heart was pounding and I felt like I had to faint a lot. It did nothing for my depression, I felt worse than before! I was crying a lot, and when I wasn't crying I didn't feel anything at all. After a few weeks on 50mg I stopped taking it because I couldn't handle the side effects. Overall I was on Trazodone for 2,5 months. I had withdrawal symptoms like Insomnia, extreme anxiety, suicidal thoughts and others. I can't recommend this medication to anyone.",2,11,1

"Trazodone","Avila","March 14, 2020","-","Was on trazodone for a year for severe anxiety and mild depression,50 mg for 2 months then upped to 100mg.  Went off them a month ago. They helped with the anxiety a lot, associated with therapy ( I was agoraphobic and now only have very occasional easily manageable spikes of anxiety ) but made my energy levels drop and made me feel like a zombie. I was also sleeping too much (9+ hours a night still feeling tired in the morning, nearly impossible to wake up most days).  I went from mild to severe depression as the complete lack of energy prevented me from doing anything. Was relying on energy drinks/caffeine/supplements to get through the day. I stopped cold turkey as I couldn't stand them anymore, the withdrawals are truly horrible during the first week : hot flashes, high anxiety, irritability etc. Feel a million times better now. Only rating 3 because of significant help with anxiety.",3,7,1
"Trazodone","Georgina","December 19, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Trazodone is absolutely great for me. I'm taking 100 mg of it every night due to terrible insomnia and persisting depression. Sertraline was only making me more miserable, but trazodone worked from day 1. I sleep a lot better and have much less trouble with bad thoughts and bad mood. Some people say it makes them feel groggy, but it's just perfect for me. This medicine is not used very often as an antidepressant, but it does worth trying it if other medicines don't fit you.",10,32,1

"Trazodone","Catfairy","September 22, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was prescribed 50mg Trazadone in conjunction with 150mg wellbutrin as the wellbutrin alone wasn't sufficiently lifting my mood, and I couldn't tolerate the 300mg wellbutrin. I took it for several months, it definitely helps for sleep, didn't have trouble sleeping once while on it- which is unusual for me. But I felt awful in the mornings, foggy and headachy, like I'd been drinking a lot. I do drink a glass of wine a night, so that may exacerbate the side effects- I did feel a little better when I stopped drinking for a while. Eventually I got tired of feeling garbage all day, and have gone off it. I've been off two days, had  trouble sleeping last night but can't believe how much better I feel! This is the first time in months I've woken up with a clear head. My depression is under control at the moment so will continue with just the wellbutrin.",2,11,1

In April this year I began to feel depressed and GP put me on another Anti Depressant, Sertraline. He advised me to wean myself off Trazodone over a 2 or 3 week period. Never experienced anything like it. Awful hot and cold sweats, trembling and worst of all , Insomnia.  6 months have passed but the insomnia is almost as bad as ever, despite my taking strong sleeping tablets. My advice is to think very carefully before using this drug, as it has really messed up my life big time.",1,22,1

I’ve tried a lot of antidepressants and I found I’m also having trouble sleeping and struggling with depression.  I’m 63 years old. My doctor prescribed trazodone 50 mg and I’ve only had it one night so far. I haven’t had a good night sleep in a long time and I actually feel human today. I’m very sensitive to meds so I had to cut the 50 mg and I’m going to try 25 mg tonight because I felt a bit groggy this morning  but I am sensitive to meds. I really am hopeful for this to work.  A bit soon to have an opinion but I haven’t felt this good in a long time. Also told it’s not habit forming. I was sleepy  15 minutes after I took it. And oh yes make sure there’s food in your stomach. Made me feel a bit nauseous so I had a couple soda crackers. Hope this helps some people I’ve seen a lot of positive comments made.

I’ve been told to drop back down to 150mg.  Will this improve? Anyone experienced similar, pushed through and got a different result. I trust my GP but I’m not sure how long I can continue to feel like this. I'm so panicked &amp; awful. All day I feel confused, dizzy, mix my words up, forget everything.

I felt so great everyday when I took them, I would always take them 9pm at night, then get tired half an hour after taking them. It definitely helped with sleep. I was ready for the day at 7am. I had so much motivation while on this medication. For anyone that is thinking of starting Trazodone, remember it takes a month to get the full effect. It doesn't start working as soon as you start taking it. I think it does work with sleep right away because it makes you drowsy after taking it.",10,49,1

My family and friends talked me into getting help. I started with a psychologist who was against medicine and thought she could help me with exercises. After 4 months she said that I needed to go to a psychiatrist and see about meds. I did and was put on 2 different meds with one being Trazadone.  I went on Venlafaxine and continued with 300 mg of trazadone. After a while on it I was having some issues with waking up. He reduces it to 200 mg and I have not looked back. I sleep through the night after years of getting up to clear the house several times. My nightmares continue but for the most part I do not remember.

Every time I would sit up from a lying down position I felt like I was going to pass out, and honestly the whole experience really scared me. I let the fear take over for quite a while and the medication sat in my bedside table untouched for about four months, maybe longer. Until I reached a point where I felt like I had no choice but to give it another try. I have struggled with severe insomnia, depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I have refused to take medication out of fear of addiction and the lengthy list of side  effects associated with most of them. I have been taking trazodone every other night to every night for about three weeks now and I have never slept better. I feel generally happier and my anxiety is better controlled.

Within 7 days, I was not only sleeping better but feeling better than I had in years. I went back to my PCP and requested to be kept on Trazodone (I do still take Lamotrigine as well). I'm at 3 weeks (full effectiveness) and could not be happier. My anxiety, depression, paranoia, and exhaustion have all but vanished. Here are some of the side effects I experienced during the first two weeks of being on Trazodone: dizziness, confusion, and mild nausea. All of these have passed.  I exercise daily and eat right. No coffee, no tea, and a limited amount of sugar. No pot. Going to bed at the same time every night is also a plus.",8,52,1

I've noticed that sometimes I'll be in a good mood and I'll feel myself get overly happy? Hard to explain, but it's better than having suicidal thoughts on an almost daily basis, am I right? It helped with my anxiety-related insomnia a bit and the amount of anxiety attacks I'd have per day has decreased (but my anxiety is still pretty bad).

For the first few days/weeks it was harder to get up in the morning but having caffeine really helps. I would always feel low before this medication, sad, hopeless and have no energy.

I believe its important to take the amount that starts working consistently for you as you titrate up to a dose that starts working.  And you need to give it time to build up in your system. I'm up to 250 mg when I go to bed, I will take another 50 mg and that tends to give me a couple hours more sleep if I wake up too early.  What's really amazing about this medicine is that I no longer struggle with depression or anxiety.

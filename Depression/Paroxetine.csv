"Paroxetine","Skye","June 6, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Paxil (paroxetine):</b>			 Seems like a lot of people have a good experience with Paxil and I really wish I could say the same. I took it for about 2.5 months and had chronic diarrhea the whole time which only seemed to get worse as time went on. And of course the usual sexual side effects that come with SSRIs. I couldn't handle it anymore, having diarrhea for that long just left me feeling very sick all the time. So I tapered off which is where things have gone from bad to worse. I've never had a problem coming off of any type of medication in my life but this is HORRIBLE. Brain zaps, nightmares, highly increase depression and crying spells. This stuff is freaking poison to my body. I would never recommend this to anyone.",0,1,1
"Paroxetine","Francesca","May 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started taking Paroxetine 12,5 mg three months ago. The first 10 days I had lots of side effects: I felt weak, I sweated a lot, I had a feeling that my body was radiating hot from inside (like when you have temperature), and my anguish actually worsened.  After two months and a half I can say it did not helped me, I was experiencing lack of motivation and energy, always postponing things, all I wanted to do was to stay in bed. I had to force myself to do things, even simple things as replying a message. So as it produced me a negative effect on my everyday life I decided to stop taking it. My doctor prescribed me Agomelatine (which I guess has not been approved in the US) and I am feeling great! I feel more like myself :) have energy again, and the best part is that is has improved significantly the quality of sleep",2,0,1

"Paroxetine","billybilly23","December 12, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","1. WITHDRAWAL AND GETTING OFF PAROXITNE (PAXIL). ***The way to avoid this horrendous withdrawal, asking your doctor, is to slowly lower the dose AND AT THE SAME TIME STARTING FLUOXETINE (PROZAC) at a low dose (this process is called 'titration'), then when you have stopped using Paroxetine altogether, come of the fluoxetine (prozac) and you can avoid the vast majority of withdrawals from Paroxetine. Also works with any other antidepressant.*** For example. If you use 40mg of Paroxetine, drop to 30mg while starting 10mg/20mg of Fluoxetine. This works, if you don't know, because Paroxetine (Paxil) has a *SHORT HALF-LIFE* [MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS] of *1-2 days*.  This means the rate (speed, time) at which it the drug leaves your body. The drug stays in there even after you completely stop because the chemical Paroxetine hasn't exited the body yet and the speed at which it exists is determined by the HALF-LIFE.",9,4,1

I used to not have even a slight headache, now I have a daily, non stop headache/ pain behind my eyes and throbbing neck and headache pain..also I think it gave me suicidal/homicidal ideation. My doctor is weaning me off. The worst part is the weaning off, if I couldn't get to my pharmacy for this refill after 2 days without it I had to send my partner because my head felt so strange I was afraid I might get in a car wreck.

Paxil helped me treat my depression but as soon as I determined my symptoms of depression was due to ADHD I decided to get off of it. It's been like living in the depths of a dark pit. Paxil helps you but destroys you. Please please please please please weigh your options. I've been on it for awhile and getting off of it is WORSE! I can and can't suggest this medication or any antidepressant. I urge you to determine what is causing your depression and treat that underlying problem. It will save you from these types of medication that will develop a strong dependence and the minute you do not need them and decide to go off them, it's going to be an absolute WAR!

I only take 10mg - half the recommended dose. Paroxetine peaks in your body at around 6hrs, so I find if I take this just before bed I sleep through any negative side effects. When starting I just feel a little out of it and headachey for a few days, but not much different to how I feel while depressed anyway. Paroxetine makes me able to function normally, takes away my suicidal thoughts and social anxieties, and allows me to handle difficult situations without wanting to die. The only side effect I experience is less sensation during sex (I'm female) - a small price to pay for not committing suicide. I have cyclical depression so I come on and off this and it IS NOT as bad as everyone says. I feel pretty out of it for about a week, and then back to normal after 2 weeks.",8,12,1

It worked a treat and I even managed to travel and work overseas shortly after for several years. I got off ok by slowly weaning myself off overtime without issues. 15 years later due to 6 months of chronic pain and then taking benzos for insomnia, depression kicked in. I went back to paroxetine which enabled me to  wean myself off Benzos over a month and sorted my depression by week 3. First 2 weeks are rough, it increased anxiety (although maybe benzo withdrawal related - hard to tell) gave me distressing OCD thoughts, worsened dark thoughts and also worsened insomnia (most people should take in the morning). Week 3 was better and week 4 back to almost normal and along with CBT helped insomnia despite decreasing benzo dosage (which was in hindsight probably early signs of depression). I'm a lot more balanced and proactive now. Thoughts of suicide and OCD gone. Anxiety is mild.",9,6,1

And the worse part is that I have bloating in my stomach area. The rest of my body is fine, still thin, but my stomach sticks out to the point where people have asked me if I’m pregnant. I’m sure a good bit of my belly fat is a result of me drinking so much soda and not eating the best foods, but when I was off this medicine my stomach was a lot less fat. Literally it’s just my stomach that is fat not the rest of my body. This medication does also increase your appetite. Still, it’s a great medicine for depression and OCD.",0,13,2

I think my depression is just normal to me and I've probably been depressed for many years without even knowing, just a feeling that something isn't right.   A failed relationship a while back, heightened my realisation that something is wrong and the pain of losing someone close was like a final straw for me.  I guess it might be true that everyone comes into your life for a reason, even if it is only meant to be for a short time.   After countless months and days googling and doing tests online, trying to figure out what might be wrong with me, I finally got the courage to go see my doctor.  After a few visits, he prescribed me Paxil and thinks this might help get me on the right track.  You see my depression isn't the usual in that I try to go about my daily life as normal as I can, it's called walking or smiling depression.  Behind it all though, I'm crippled with self doubt, negative thoughts, anxiety and constant feeling of sadness.  I feel guilty a lot, distance myself from my family and friends regularly and sometimes feel so down I cry for what seems like no reason at all.  I put on brave face to people and go about daily life as best I can, but behind the mask I am suffering.  I never really felt like I fit in and it's like I have to try to act to be happy in every day situations.  It's hard to describe, but it's almost like I'm standing behind my shadow.  I always look at other people and wonder what it's like to be just happy.  I could never bring myself to telling anyone how I really felt, I guess it's only the last year or so that I became more aware and really accepting that something isn't right.  It's been so long that I have felt this way, I really don't know what normal is anymore.  I have lost 2 girlfriends  largely due to my low self esteem and low confidence finally taking its toll on the relationship, it's like I just expected them to leave, who would want to stay with a loser like me is how I portrayed myself to them.. That's probably the hardest pill to swallow through all this.  I know if I was mentally stronger, I could have held on to something good. I know I have it in me to go change my life around.  Everybody sees it in me, but I feel trapped in my own body and mind.  I have a lot of trouble concentrating and I seem to always be so indecisive about what action to take.

I've evened out my ups and downs and don't have as bad of temper as I did before starting Paxil.  I've taken it for 4 years on the advice of my Gastro doctor.  My daughter says that she has REALLY noticed a difference and I feel much better.  I just wish I had found it earlier in life.  No side effects unless I forget a dose and then I get a little achy.",0,113,11

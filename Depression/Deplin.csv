"Deplin","Jonathan","February 26, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I took this for a while at the recommendation of my psychiatrist. I have the double mthfr mutation. It did nothing for me and is prohibitively expensive. I’m not sure if I buy into their mthfr serotonin theory, but it seems to work for some. For me, I would get these weird sensations in my hands and feet, almost like they were heavier or more sensitive, and I felt like my sleep was less restful (even I got 8 hours consistently) because I was always tired. It made me feel off as well, but I assume that is just depression medication in general.",1,1,1

"Deplin","Tina","August 30, 2019","-","I’m a psychiatric nurse and have seen many medications work and many not. For me, Deplin has worked quite well. I’ve stopped taking it before with a marked increase in depression. With Deplin I feel genuine happiness and want to smile. We all know people with depression are pros at the  fake smile  but my smile is from the heart. At the risk of sounding like a marketer for Deplin, there have been a few times I’ve tear up because I’m afraid the happiness will go away. I enjoy being well and don’t take what I have right now for granted. I know the studies aren’t great concerning Deplin but for the people who do respond well to it, Deplin can be a life changer and a life saver.",0,69,1

I cut the Deplin back to 7.5 MG and in three days it is doing the same thing as the 15 MG.  I would assume if you had a folic deficiency it would work.  However, I must have enough and this just overloads my system.  Not for me cannot get off of it fast enough.",4,20,1

I assumed it was normal for me to feel that way. My doctor decided to prescribe Deplin. This was years ago. Anyway, one day, after having been taking it for about 3 weeks, I woke up and realized I felt GREAT! Like the fog had lifted. I have so many great days now.

My doc did genetic testing for my severe anxiety and panic disorder and found I have the MTHFR gene mutation where I don’t break down folate. He prescribed me this with my antidepressant and it’s been a miracle. I’m no longer anxious, I do not have panic attacks, my depersonalization and derealization is completely gone. I praise the Lord in how good and healed I feel. I’m a RN and I suggest all those who are suffering to give this a try. Hang in there, God is with you. There is hope. You will feel better.

Cymbalta has helped me the most, but I still get hit with very dark times.  Last month, my doctor gave me Deplin samples.  I took them, but with very low expectations.  Three weeks into it, I began to notice a change...normalcy!  It crept up on me.  I stopped needing a 2 hour nap, I feel clear minded.  My mind doesn’t feel like a Los Angeles freeway.  I am calm and feel content.  I can’t wait to tell my doctor tomorrow.  I also needed a D3 prescription. I am sure my father could have felt so much better with these food meds.",8,63,1

I had struggled with, and eventually refused, taking anti-depressants because the side effects were worse than the cure. Eventually, a counsellor convinced me to try Deplin. After a few weeks, there was a noticeable shift in my mood. It was like a curtain had been lifted and I felt normal. A few months later, I ran out of the Deplin but didn't want to spend the money to get it refilled. Approximately two weeks later, wham!, the curtain dropped and the depression was back. Lesson learned.",9,89,1

My psychiatrist finally gave me deplin and in just days I felt better than I had in a long time!I also starting taking L-carnitine which if youve been depressed for a long time you are probably deficient in it. But I know it was the deplin. You have nothing to lose please try it! I had absolutely no side effects. I have more energy but mainly the horrible painful depression lifted in 3 days! I am beyond thrilled and would pay any amount of money per month to keep this medicine. Please give it a try.",10,79,1
"Deplin","Seeking28","September 4, 2018","-","Update to my previous post:   I've now been taking Deplin for close to a year. It serves as an add on to my anti depressant meds. It hasn't been a magical booster to improve my severe, resistant depression as well as my horrible anxiety. However, over a year's time, Deplin has helped me feel just enough better to justify its cost. A very subtle improvement that is difficult to describe. I'm glad that I stuck with it; not at all noticeable until at least 9 or 10 months. And that time frame ( for subtle change ) isn't acceptable if you are miserable. But, I was improving just enough with my other meds to allow me to continue taking Deplin--just in case it began making a difference ....whenever? Plus, my dr. told me it was good for my overall health,  regardless if it touched the depression. This made it easier for me to continue taking it despite feeling no benefit for a long time.",8,29,1

The best medicine for me was Lexapro and klonopin.  However, after 10 years on Lexapro, it lost its efficacy. My psychiatrist suggested Deplin. It took about 9 weeks for it to work . I hung in there because of him, and posts like this . It has reduced my depression and , surprisingly my anxiety. I am thrilled . Deplin is a true blessing .  Don’t give up if it does work for you quickly. I’ve read it can talk much longer for some people ; even 10 weeks .  Have patience ; it’s worth it !!",10,72,1

That being said Deplin does have its benefits.",6,19,1
"Deplin","Zarathustra","March 1, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I had the swab genetic test done. I lack the MFTHR gene that creates the enzyme that breaks down folic acid to folate. Without folate depression is very likely. My DR prescribed Deplin as it would take 60 bottles of over the counter folate to equate to the convenient orange capsule. The first three weeks my depression and anxiety got worse. My doctor wasn't helpful but I kept taking it. I’m around week 5 and I am able to see my compulsive eating as not good for me as I am morbidly obese. I don't feel overly happy but more in control in a chaotic World and able to focus more. I'll chat to my doctor about getting off Lamictal once I've had a couple months on Deplin. I am far less paranoid and explosive but I have routine scary dreams being out of control. I can't put my finger on it but I think I am better off with Deplin and apprehensive to go off it. This is not the placebo effect talking. I think I can lose weight and get off the bipolar meds. I pay $160 for three months supply.",10,33,1
"Deplin","Seeking28","December 16, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","MUST take Deplin and not a generic and definitely not over the counter folic acid or folate!  These can make things worse!  My C spinal fluid showed that I have a less prominent type of folate abnormality. Wasn't detected in a gene swab test. Anyway, just started taking 15mg as an Anti-depressant add-on. Made my depression &amp; anxiety worse!!! I would stop taking it, but my doc has me taking a lower dose as she recognizes that Deplin can cause a worsening of symptoms in certain folks. It just needs to be started low and gradually increased.  So, please start with a low dose if it makes you MORE anxious/depressed at 15mg. Too early to say it helps, but the lower dose is needed, to start, for some. And it may take many months to work--for some!",0,28,1

The first dose of Deplin of 15 mg was too much for me and I felt edgy and anxious.  I then tried the 7.5 dosage and honestly felt like myself for the first time in months.  Clarity, energy and focus!  One side effect was headaches and then I went online to MTHFR.net and learned I needed to supplement with a few things to feel better.

In addition, I have been battling severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Gastritis and severe upper gastric pain for 10 months.  Most days I have been unable to eat other than breakfast.

Bad enough that I could not turn my head or look up or down without great discomfort. Kind of felt like I had whiplash. I did some research and found that the muscle pain can be a side effect of both medications. I have not ever had this problem on Wellbutrin alone, so I'm inclined to think the Deplin caused this. I quit taking both medications because I couldn't function with the pain and stiffness any longer and 2 days later the pain is still there but is slowly subsiding.",4,58,3

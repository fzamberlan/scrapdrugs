"Paliperidone","Bear","November 23, 2019","-","It's not for me. This medication didn't do much for me at first, but three weeks after use I was bumped up from 3 mg to 6 mg, and a week later it caused me, a 25 year old male, to completely stop manufacturing sperm, develop tender breasts, and ultimately made me extremely depressed. It's as if my testosterone has been shut off. I'm ceasing use now. Just thankful that I haven't started lactating.... I hope! O_O",1,2,1
"Paliperidone","danimp711","August 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Honestly this has ruined my IQ, personality and I am left to have no thoughts or emotions. I was detained and sectioned (2)  in London and subsequently misdiagnosed as psychotic - despite the fact that there were clear signs that I was already depressed, but I was not having hallucinations nor hearing voices. Does anyone know if the effects of this drug go away? or if my brain will function the way it used to ?    I don't know what to do.",1,16,1
"Paliperidone","Nancy","March 28, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Hi,  I was forced to take this drug 3 times @ 39 mg per shot. My last shot was given about 6 months back. I was actually misdiagnosed. I was suffering with depression my family doc forced this drug onto me.  Terrible side effects - my speech became slurry, there was neck stiffness, watering of the eyes, sleepiness and dullness existed throughout the day, excessive salivation, difficulty in walking, memory loss, loss of libido, amennorhea and most of all terrible weight gain. I gained 20 lbs already and I feel I am still gaining weight. I could recover from other symptoms with the help of a smarter doctor but not the weight gain. Anyone please suggest me if you lost weight after stopping this drug and if so how long did you take. I am a physically active person who is originally thin built.",1,16,1

"Paliperidone","Unhappy1234","November 21, 2017","-","I was given this drug after suffering a stressful episode from PTSD trauma. I don't think it is for PTSD. As soon as I got injected with this drug I had a horrible feeling of extreme restlessness. I could not sit still and felt the need to be constantly moving. It was horrible and then my cholesterol and prolactin both became elevated. I talked to the doctor about this and she took me seriously. My hand has began contracting and relaxing against my will. It wants to make a fist constantly.  My doctor will be switching me to abilify and off of this horrible drug. It has caused me a lot of suffering and problems. It was also making me lactate. I'm very upset to have been put on this drug. It hurt me a lot.",0,12,1
"Paliperidone","Don't ever allow chemical rape","August 18, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I gain 60 pounds in 45 days of this med.  I had many side effects of which was listed on website.  You name it, I basically had it.  Made me crazy, majorly depressed etc.  This is the worst medication I've ever received and it was given by a Dr whom never called my shrinks, my past Dr's of long term status nor even my personal family.   This drug states blood work etc is required to be done before issued.",0,9,1
"Paliperidone","vet one of millions","October 20, 2015","-","I had two half injections of this medication to treat my depression. I experienced many of the side effects that are listed. Some of those include discharge from my breast, missed menstrual cycle, weight gain, and other funny feelings to my body. Upon experiencing these side effects I decided that this medication was not for me.",5,8,1
"Paliperidone","Momma junks","July 14, 2015","-","One doc put me on 1 1/2 every day at first and about a year later reduced it to 1/ 1/2 every other night. Then she quit and a nurse practitioner put me on 3mg every night in May which increased my motivation but by now July my concentration is worse. And my anxiety is back. But I attribute that to her increasing my Cymbalta from 30 to 60 mg which was tried before and didn't work. So 4 days ago I went back on 30 and my anxiety has settled down.",6,4,1

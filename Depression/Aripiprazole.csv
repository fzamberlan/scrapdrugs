"Aripiprazole","abilified101","May 26, 2020","-","I have only been taking 2.5 mg of Abilify for 4 days so far, along with 50 mg Luvox for OCD and Depression (that I was on for about 10 weeks prior to adding Abilify to augment its' effects).  Somehow I feel an EXTREMELY noticeable improvement in the deep depression I had. Unfortunately, you just have to test out these drugs for yourself.        The second day, I noticed I had a newfound sense of calm and drive to do various activities like running and playing piano and hang out with people instead of spending the entire day alone in bed with no drive or ambition.  Even with a migraine today, I am out of bed and more functional.      For my severe OCD, I am still suffering, but I have a feeling ERP therapy I am about to start will be most beneficial in changing my brain (and the meds will make this easier).  I can't believe this could be a placebo, because of the HUGE difference.  On Luvox alone, I was moody, and deeply depressed/hopeless too often, and so exhausted.",10,2,1

It felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster inside my own head, nauseous and ready to hurl, yet I couldn’t get off.

It's not that I have extra energy, I just feel less overwhelmed by doing things and therefore am able to do them. It's helped me lose weight by increasing my ability to be active, and also decreasing my stress/emotional eating. It increased my sex drive, which was something I was struggling with in depression. Overall I recommend this drug for MDD. However, I just recently increased from 7.5mg to 15mg and am starting to feel dizzy and get head aches. Maybe this will lesson or pass soon. If it gets worse then I'll reduce my dose. But I've found this medication to be particularly helpful whereas I've tried a LOT of other meds and find no results.

I was also able to start exercising and eating right without crazy cravings - so I lost about 10 lbs. The doctor increased me to 2.5mg/day and things really went downhill.  I can only sleep for 4-6 hours at a time, so I have to nap twice during the day and as soon as I take the medicines I'm so tired I'm basically incapable of driving. I'm cutting back down by half today hoping it was a dosing issues.",0,133,11
"Aripiprazole","Anonymous","May 17, 2009","-","<b>Abilify (aripiprazole):</b>			 Over the years I've tried a number of different medications. I tried switching to Abilify from Seroquel because of weight gain. My mood on it was good, but the side effects far out weighed any positive reaction. I couldn't sit still and I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. As far as all of my experiences with medications it's probably the worst I've ever felt. I literally did not sleep for DAYS, I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't get comfortable in ANY position (standing, sitting, or even laying down), and I felt like my thoughts were out of control. But it was worth a shot. I went on to a combination of Zoloft and Lamictal, which works very well for me.",0,39,11

I currently take 2.5 mg and that is enough to pop me out of the depression.  At 5 mg I was very flat, anxious, and my joints ached.  Everyone is different, but this drug can be very helpful.",0,154,11

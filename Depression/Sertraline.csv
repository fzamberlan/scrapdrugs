My anxiety and very low mood were affecting every aspect of my life. I was suicidal. I started with 50mg for the first month. Only side effects for me was a bit of nausea the first week and a lack of appetite.  By week 4 we went up to 100mg and everything has improved significantly! I can separate emotions from facts which I couldn't do before. The people I thought were against me don't seem to bother me whatsoever now. I've gotten my life back.

It’s a game changer for me! I’m on 50mg/day.  Give it time to work because it’s worth going through the horrific side effects to feel like I do.

The anxiety/OCD/rage was worse than the depression though. I've been on Sertraline (100mg) for a collective 4 years and its pretty much done the same thing: It ELIMINATES anxiety, OCD and rage/anger issues. It's better than benzos in doing it as well. The problem is what is doesn't do: For me, it had no effect on the depression/mood (which was the point?).  Side effects: Fatigue (like a zombie), yawning, feeling disconnected, and makes you have terrible quality sleep.If you're a male, it makes it difficult to ejaculate. In closing, I would use this for major anxiety/OCD/PTSD/anger issues, but it doesn't lift your mood. Side effects aside, it will change your life, but please get a sleeping tablet as well.",9,10,1

Up and down over the next 4 weeks then up to 100, On that for 8 weeks  and again happy a few days, low a few days. Felt it maybe wasn’t working which I was distraught about, but these reviews really helped. So many times I thought about giving up but many reviews said to persevere. Side effects of nausea/increased anxiety can be horrible but isn’t 24/7. Propanolol 10mgs and diazepam 2mgs helped.  Up to 150mg and again happy days bad days. Nearly gave up again.

I almost gave up several times they were so bad. I experienced explosive diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, overeating, extreme tiredness, insomnia, loss of sex drive, inability to orgasm, loss all emotion and severe anxiety. I had to take time off work to deal with the physical and emotional side effects of this drug. I also had to have someone come and stay with me. Despite the terrible side effects, it has made me feel like myself for the first time in 10 years. Thanks to this drug, the negative thoughts in my head are locked away in a dungeon somewhere and crying no longer rules my life. I feel happy, strong, confident, motivated and finally at peace with myself. I know this drug is not for everyone, but it works for me and if I can encourage anyone to just buckle down through the side effects...you'll make it to the other side.",10,65,2

The next few days I wake up periodically to my limbs twitching like crazy, I have bruxism (grinding of teeth) and sometimes I wake up by jumping upright or throwing myself around in bed. My left pupil is more dilated than my right. I will say, aside from side effects - everyone around me has noticed I am much more calm lately. I am taking it for  OCD, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I do get random anxiety at night due to side effects, haven't felt depressed at all in a week.

My depression was severe and depression as well as anxiety runs in my family. I know some people don't like medication and some people with less severe depression or anxiety might be able to do without it. Everyone is different. I have learned that depression is a disorder for some though because the mood chemicals like seratonin and dopamine just don't work accurately in the brain for some of us without medication. It can be similar to anemia where the body struggles   with lack of iron for the blood. If you need medication to get through don't feel bad because you can't control the chemicals in your own brain. I just worry about the possibilities of the system building a tolerance. Hopefully that wont happen though as it didn't with another medication I have taken for sixteen years for epilepsy.",0,44,6

After a few months although over a stone in weight had fallen off me, I was becoming increasingly irritable, emotional and dark thoughts returned. After this triggered several nights of no sleep whatsoever, I recognised the signs and began taking Sertraline again. I had forgotten how brutal the initial side effects were, I basically did not sleep for around 2 weeks, felt more depressed and anxious than before and generally like I’d been hit by a train. I also felt they were taking longer to work than last time and I despaired wondering if they would work again. But of course they did, I am in week 5 now, back to sleeping like a baby and feel actually happy and able to cope with my life.

A lot of reviews after taking one day, couple weeks etc. you need a full three months for maximum effectiveness. Not that it takes that long to start getting relief.

The cons are it made me not very motivated, felt kind of numb to strong feelings. Not feeling urgency about my life.  I wouldn’t take it again for years bc it blocked my clear perspective.

I was previously on another anti depression medication of little benefit. My side effects at the beginning were terrible. I felt sickly and dizzy but it is definitely worth persisting. Truth be told this medication saved my life! But took a while to work so bear with it and struggle through. I have now been on it 5 months and whilst it's not a quick fix it did reduce the frequency and severity of suicide ideation. It doesn't fix everything just makes me feel like I can cope better and makes me a little more rational. However I still have some bad days and still struggle with motivation. I was at the point of not looking after myself, couldn't get out of bed, refusing to eat or take medication. I dare say I was on my way to end up getting committed.

I started out at 25mg for a week and then 50mg and 100mg and 150mg and then 200mg over a 6 month period and have been there for 5 weeks. I think the medication helps, but you have to do more to really get back to normal. The drug helps keep more serotonin in your brain from what’s already in your body. You have to do more to really increase the serotonin levels in your body and your brain. Exercising helps for sure, but I finally figured out that caffeine and alcohol weren’t helping and had to mostly eliminate consumption of those. I read where they actually deplete your serotonin. Recently the drug really helped change my thought process, which was really warped by the anxiety/depression. It’s amazing how they can really alter your perception of reality. Just started taking GABA as well because you can be deficient in that also, which causes anxiety. Also omega 3. You can try tryptophan and 5-htp too.",0,21,13

Let me start off by saying that this drug, literally, saved my LIFE. I've always battled anxiety and panic attacks, and was on a small dose of Paxil and that seemed to take the edge off. I took it on and off for years. After I had my second baby at 28, I got terrible postpartum depression. I had thoughts of suicide, racing thought constantly, couldn't nap and took forever to fall asleep at night. I literally spent three months just thinking and obsessing over how horrible I felt. I wanted to crawl out of my skin and die. I was barely showering, brushing my teeth and hair and would stay in the same sweatpants and shirt for days. I could go on forever by I'll get to the point. After three months of pure hell, I went to my doctor for help. I was prescribed 50 ML of Zoloft. After being on it for 4 weeks, I stopped taking it because it wasn't working. After going another 2 weeks feeling miserable, I went to my doctor again.  She recommended we up the dose and stay on it for atleast 6 weeks. Well, after two weeks on 100 ML, I realized I was feeling better. I would go minutes without thinking negatively, then I would go hours, then full days. It feels SO good to feel like myself again. I truly thought I would be miserable forever. Please get help and try something if you are feeling terrible. Everyone is curable with the right drug and right dose. I wish I got help sooner. TRY THIS! It will work! If for some reason it doesn't, try something else! GET HELP NOW! I was doing the same thing you are - googling all types of antidepressants convinced there was no cure and they would never work. Stop spending your life wondering when you will be yourself again.

The mistake that I have made and others make far too often is to quit the meds once you feel better. If you feel bad before you find the right med that makes you feel better, then you should keep in mind that it is the med that's working. If it's working, stay on it. If you have been diagnosed. With ADHD or Bipolar, or a combination like many have, it's probably not going away...it's there to stay. I will agree that it sucks being labeled with any mental condition, and I know it's no fun taking meds, especially meds for the head....but if they work, and you need them...stay on them!

I find too I am much more rational in my thought processes and am more confident of choices I make. I have several medical conditions that contribute to feeling depressed, overwhelmed, and yes, even suicidal but since I began my therapy with Zoloft, I want to live. Without Zoloft, I did not.

I was worried that it might cause weight gain and that there may be sexual side effects.  I was on this medication for 2 years and DID NOT experience weight gain or sexual side effects.  The first few months I was on it I had some stomach upset and trouble sleeping but that disappeared shortly after.

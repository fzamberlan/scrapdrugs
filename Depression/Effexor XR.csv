"Effexor XR","Teppum","June 4, 2020","-","I had severe anxiety in 2016, it was truly crippling. Along with panic attacks and thinking I was dying all the time, I experienced depersonalization/derealization every day. Effexor XR truly saved my life.  I take my pills at night, and if I miss one dose, I know immediately the next day by how I feel. It’s a horrible feeling. I also described it as my head was skipping, but I see others describe it as brain zaps. That’s truly what it feels like. Besides that though, this medication changed everything for me.",9,5,1
"Effexor XR","Gamergirl4283","April 15, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Effexor  was by far the worst medication I have taken. If you miss even 1 dose within hours you are sick and having withdrawal symptoms. It took a good 6 months before the brain zaps stopped. Run away. It's terrible.",1,13,1

I had a head injury from a car accident and have been suffering from facial nerve pain, neck injury, and depression. This drug has improved my quality of life. I highly recomend it for nerve pain. I started out taking 37.5mg for a month. Then, 75mg. The 75mg dose works for me. It took 6 weeks for me to feel the benefits.",8,15,1
"Effexor XR","Mickey","February 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have only been taking Effexor for a little over 2 months and noticed that if I was even an hour late taking my daily dose I’d feel nauseous and anxious.  I also began to notice that I was feeling nauseous anytime I didn’t have a full stomach, so weight gain was inevitable. I decided this drug was making my physical symptoms seriously distressing enough to outweigh any good it may be doing.  I was shocked at how awful the withdrawal symptoms have been even though I was  only on it for two months at a dose of 75mg.  I’ve been experiencing nausea and  brain zaps  for two weeks now. My GP put me on Effexor, but after meeting a psychiatrist at a dinner function &amp; casually asking her thoughts on Effexor she said she doesn’t prescribe it, its withdrawal is so awful.  I’m glad I’m getting off it, but alarmed at how nasty the withdrawal is, can't imagine how bad withdrawal would be for those at a higher dosage and for much longer than my 2 months.",1,23,1
"Effexor XR","KitKat","February 23, 2020","-","I have been on Celexa in the past and had done well on it until the last few months, so my therapist recommended that I be switched to something else. Effexor XR was suggested as part of my treatment plan. For the first two weeks, I was on 37.5 milligrams + 10 milligrams of Citalopram and seemed to do well on it. After that, I was supposed to double the dosage up to 75 milligrams. When I doubled the dosage, my body had horrible side effects: I missed a full week of work; I was not sleeping; I was sweating in my sleep; I was starting to argue with my fiance over stupid things; and it caused suicidal ideation. I ended up in the hospital, missed more work, back at the hospital again trying to seek more treatment, and had to see my therapist twice in one week demanding a new medication.  I have been off of this medication for a week and have been on Paxil (a drug that is in the same family as Citalopram) and have been doing well - like much, much better.",1,9,1

This was literally a life saver for me! Switched to XR when it became available. I was on it for about 3 yrs, before deciding I no longer wanted to be anchored down by antidepressants. The withdrawals sucked...but didn't last long. I'm considering going back on it and am now 37 yrs old.",10,28,1
"Effexor XR","Grateful","February 4, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Everyone's different, for me this one's a LIFE SAVER! My depression began 15yrs ago. In 2014 I hit my lowest point. Previous dr had me on several meds that didn't mix well together. That whole year is a blur, I don't remember any of it except for the few grand mal seizures they caused. Eventually attempted suicide with one of the meds and ended up in a mental hospital twice within a month. My new psychiatrist took me off everything and started me on this, topped out at 150mg (which I am to this day, 6yrs later, still taking). I can't thank that psychiatrist and this miracle drug enough. Taking with Bupropion (Wellbutrin) and I'm not sure which one, but I believe one of them has got rid of my sex drive. I prefer no sex drive over that really dark place I was in. Also, if I miss taking them a couple of days in a row (again, not sure which one is causing it) I experience extreme vertigo.. not fun. Other than that, I have no other complaints just absolute gratefulness. LOVE IT!",10,34,1

Nothing has snapped me out of a major depression episode quicker than this Effexor. Already take 80mg strattera for ADD. Venlafaxine kicked in almost immediately and has been tremendously helpful. I have read all the horror stories about going off of it but I was desperate for relief and this really did the trick. I don't want to be on it forever tho.",10,24,1

My depression is great now and has been for year the only negative is my lack in sex drive and sleeping a lot. Not sure if that’s all the meds or just my lazy arse.

"Effexor XR","Elle","January 7, 2020","-","Our son 16 yrs old was put on Effexor xr, in January 2019 for depression , after prozac wasn't working on him. The dose was slowly increased to 225mg, at the time his psychiatrist went on holiday and he developed dilated pupils, racing heart, jiggling, sweating, took him to the GP who immediately took an ECG, reduced his meds, said that he was developing seretonin syndrome. The psychiatrist did not have a replacement while away and had planned to add another antidepressant as effexor wasn't working. The reduction side effects have been horrible, made more manageable by using micronutrients but still losing a lot of school time. From August to December we have gone down from 225mg to 42, reductions have become smaller and slower as the dose reduces. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, head zaps, fatigue, insomnia are his side effects. I wish I had done more homework. Since reading more, using it on under 18 is not recommended.",0,14,1

It has completely gotten rid of my suicidal ideation as well as tremendously reducing my depression and anxiety. Without it, I'm quite certain that I would not be alive today.  After trying to get off of it a couple times and having those bad feeling come back, I have become resigned to the fact that I will likely be on this drug for life, but am okay with that to be honest. I don't really have any side effects from the drug, at least not that I am aware of.

"Effexor XR","Son","November 11, 2019","-","Effexor is a powerful drug that is extremely destructive, I was slowly losing sanity after only couple of months of taking it. Unfortunately there is a choice from 1 to 10, not -10, that would be my rating. Effexor withdrawal, as bad as can be is more desirable than ever taking one more tablet. I noticed that they don't come with any instructions and warnings, if I read it, I would never take one. Lucky I guess I wasn't using them for long",1,26,2

It was awful  I felt like a zombie I couldn’t function or think or concentrate or feel. Nausea and slurred speak, extreme fatigue. I stopped the medicine after the second pill.

It was almost as if I never woke up fully. By losing my memory temporarily, I immediately panicked and started crying. This medication scared me and I no longer used it after the 3rd day.

I’ve struggled with relationships and often find myself extremely depressed and more anxious than ever. I started Effexor about 2 weeks ago now and the first few days were much like the experiences listed on here. I have done MDMA before and it does feel like that for the first two days. However, after I got through that stage each day has been getting better. Colors seem brighter and my motivation has started to get better. Before, I had struggled with finding any interest in life and everything seems a little bit more open each day I wake up. I do have some very vivid dreams and find that during the night my depression gets a little worse, but it has slowly subsided and I’m able to push away thoughts that normal frustrate me.

My first experience with treating my anxiety and depression started around 1968 with a doctor convincing my adoptive mom to put me on Ritalin- In 2004, my Dr placed me on Effexor XR. Within a week I felt relaxed and human. About a year ago I had a really bad breakdown my current doctor suggested I up the Effexor dosage to 150mg per day. It worked,  except for that I have lost my drive and ambition. I know I have things to do, they just do not seem to interest me enough. I get the things done I have to; then I just kinda slack down. Effexor saved my sanity so to speak; but have lost the extreme drive that propelled me in my younger days and I wish for that back!

I could not go to work, was getting seizures daily and living with constant nausea. But after 3 months I started to get better. The seizures became fewer and farther between and the nausea stopped.

I had my first winter without a major depressive episode and the episodes that I have now are nowhere near as intense. My anxiety is at all time lows as well and I am able to hold a job for the first time. This is all in conjunction with cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle changes. But the withdrawal symptoms from missing a dose are HORRIBLE! You get brain zaps which are similar to vertigo and flu like symptoms such as aches/pains and upset stomach.

Side effects: Night sweats and slightly fragmented sleep when raising dose; abated after 3-4 days. Ongoing constipation - extra fiber helps. Make sure to take on time; I have panic attacks the next day if I'm 6+ hours late. It's a bear to lower your dose, but taking out a grain at a time from the capsule takes care of the bad effects ;) Highly effective medication if it works with your unique physiology!

I tried an anxiolytic briefly the first week I started the Effexor but didn’t like it, so quit, but I’ve found that my negative internal narrative has improved drastically on the Effexor which has helped my anxiety significantly as well. My family and friends have noticed a huge difference in my mood and energy level. I was increased to 112.5mg daily over the winter for relapse in some depressive symptoms and just decreased to 75mg daily - having some side effects of sleep interruption with the dose titration but otherwise so far so good. My sleep was always interrupted titrating up as well, which always improved with time. My only complaint is that my sex drive decreased for a while upon starting the drug, and even though I now have it back, it’s still more difficult to orgasm. This side effect is improving over time as well, but it’s an annoyance for sure.",9,21,5

Both my psychologist and the head of psychiatry at Mayo Clinic agreed I need to stop taking it immediately (take 1/2 of 25mg if I experience brain zaps or any horrible side effects) but this medication is NOT for me, and they're thinking no SSRI or SSNI chemically reacts well with me after trying 3 and having worse side effects than what I was taking it for. I haven't been out to eat with my husband in 4 months. Everything in the world now looks different, and I still have anxiety and blurry vision, and as this medication leaves my system in the next few days, I pray my mind will get back to the way it was 4 months ago.  Thank you and I hope everyone going through anything horrible with Effexor finds relief soon.",2,25,6

"Effexor XR","Roger33","September 13, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Male, 6'2, 150lb. I take 75mg of Effexor XR in the AM and 15mg of Remeron in the PM for suicidal depression and generalized anxiety. Some days I take higher doses of 112.5mg and 30mg. The combination has worked wonders for my condition. I started on Remeron initially and titrated to 45mg/day, but did not feel it was working for my depression, although it did help with sleep and appetite. I tried gabapentin for a while and was able to quit Remeron entirely for some time (wanted to give my receptors a break). Gabapentin was great for anxiety but made me more suicidal. I quit gabapentin and went back on just 15mg of Remeron, this time also adding the Effexor. I have been very happy with the results. It seems to be the first medication that really works for me. I had significant side effects when starting Effexor, but they subsided completely after about a week- feeling high much like MDMA, and I had diarrhea and some insomnia. When I increased from 37.5 to 75 mg, the only con I noticed was lower energy level (and some yawning). I started drinking some coffee to help with that. This is a very serious medication to be taking, as I know it can be very hard to withdraw from; however, I am committed to sticking with it. Eventually may increase my dose up to 150mg. Effexor makes me feel very mellow. I am less concerned about what people think of me. I am quite confident with the ladies. My sex life has been better than ever on this med combination. I have wondered if my sense of humor is dulled, however. I am also somewhat lazy, but this may change when I go up to a higher dose. Risk-taking behaviors should be watched when increasing the dose, as I broke my ankle playing sports. Overall, I give this medication 9/10 and am very happy that I got the script. I recommend taking it with Remeron to better manage the nighttime, and to counteract the side effects. They have a wonderful synergy. My only concern is that they may eventually stop working, and I may eventually have to stop taking them and suffer the infamous withdrawals.",9,36,7

I tried Wellbutrin awhile ago, and failed miserably on it due to the anxiety it brought on. Therefore, I was hesitant at first because I heard that Effexor XR affects norepinephrine as well.

"Effexor XR","jcobb","August 19, 2008","-","I started taking Effexor XR 3 1/2 years ago while in an eating disorder treatment center. I struggled for years with major depression and took several different anti-depressants that never helped. Even after being in a treatment center for 3 months I could barely deal with my emotional issues because I was so  weighed down by the depression. They finally sent me to a new doctor who knew Effexor would be different for me. He started me off on a week of 75mg/day then the next week he upped it to 150mg and the next week he ended it at 225mg. It was like a huge dark blob was lifted off of me! I felt clear-headed, stronger and happy. I never thought I could feel that way again. I still take the 225mg dosage and have no plans of quitting.",10,100,13
"Effexor XR","britgirl","August 3, 2008","-","I have only been taking this drug for two weeks but I believe it has saved my life. I have taken so many drugs that did not work I could hardly believe this began working in just over a week. My severe depression has not gone completely but the change is huge in such a short time. I think the doctor will probably increase my dose, only on 75mg daily, and I am hopeful I will be in total remission quite soon.",9,45,13
"Effexor XR","Anonymous","July 31, 2008","-","I have been taking this medicine for 6 years and am very happy with it.  It is the first medication that has helped me to feel what I would guess is normal.  I am able to enjoy things in my life that are good.  My anxiety is less and my paranoid obsessive thoughts are much more in control.  I feel like it gets my brain in the right place to where I can think clearly.",9,45,13
"Effexor XR","Anonymous","July 27, 2008","-","Effexor XR is the only drug I have found that worked for my depression (I have tried about 10 different drugs), but I gained weight. I got off it about 3 years ago because of the weight but haven't found anything that worked as well.",7,22,13
"Effexor XR","Anonymous","July 12, 2008","-","Life changing. I was prescribed Effexor XR for depression and anxiety with attacks. I suffered for years until I hit rock bottom and saw a doctor. This was the first medication I was prescribed and after 2 weeks I saw an improvment and after a month I was a completely different person. I actually for once feel normal and I am never sad and cry for no reason.I have energy, I dont feel crappy. I am hardly ever in a bad mood and the best part is I don't feel like I am taking anything. Best decision of my life.",10,147,13
"Effexor XR","Just keep swimming...","June 19, 2008","-","In 2003, I had initially tried Remeron to deal with anxiety/insomnia but after 4 months and going through major depression, I started on Effexor.  I took Ativan to get me through the first few weeks for anxiety until the Effexor kicked in.  It definitely helped me get my life back.  My only problem is the weight gain - about 25 lbs.  I have tried to wean myself down from my highest dose of 225mg/day to as low as 37.5mg but had reoccuring depression and anxiety so have gone back up.",9,38,13

"Effexor XR","oxaf","March 14, 2008","-","When I first started Effexor XR, it seemed to really help for a while.  After a while we had to increase the dosage to its maximum, and had to add the max 80 mg of Prozac to keep me normal.  After about a year, I started having real problems with exhaustion and fatigue.  It took a lot of testing and doctors and finally two separate sleep studies to find that my deep sleep had been disrupted significantly -- essentially I was getting NO restorative sleep, even when I slept for 8-12 hours!",4,64,13

"Trintellix","Lee1209","June 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started Trintellix 2 months ago for anxiety/depression. I've been on Wellbutrin which helps my mood &amp; can counteract some sexual side effects so I’ve stayed on it but it hasn’t really helped my anxiety. I’ve been on Zoloft, lexapro (horrible experience) and cymbalta, all had side effects I ultimately found unlivable.  Honestly, starting trintellix was rough but if you can manage, stick with it! I had pretty bad nauseousness but only threw up once within the first few days of starting, &amp; I started super slow &amp; low. No other side effects and this is the first med that has not affected my sexual function.  My anxiety is lessened and I feel hopeful. The daily nausea has gone away although I’ve noticed I’m more prone to motion/car sickness but my doctor gave me zofran for that.  So far this Wellbutrin/trintellix combo is the best I’ve found for me. P.S. go through their website to get your Rx card to help with costs it helped my price tremendously",9,7,1
"Trintellix","Lf","June 9, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I just started two days on this drug. I was told take it with food in the morning to stop nausea. First day my stomach was upset but no vomiting. Today I took it after I ate and within a hour or so I vomited so badly my throat is completely sore. Is this normal? This is such an expensive drug, even with insurance I paid almost $200. I don’t want to discontinue the use just yet but I am not sure I can handle the nausea and vomiting. Anyone else having these same issues?",1,5,1
"Trintellix","asadlife","May 27, 2020","-","I'm in my early 30's- been dealing with depression for almost 15 years. My former doc prescribed me trintillex. he swore it was a super clean med with out side effects. it's been 2+ years taking it (max 20mg) &amp; I had no positive effects. Don't let your doc tell you it won't/rarely causes weight gain. IT DOES, especially if you're a female. It will continue the longer on it/dose increased. Also, awful GI problems- bad nausea or bad constipation. Also only makes anxiety worse especially if you take in the AM- take in PM you can't sleep ^_^  I would stay away from this drug DEFINITELY if you have anxiety, sensitive stomach, prone to weight gain from meds. I'm done off this in 4 days! can't wait",2,15,1
"Trintellix","Jools","May 12, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Hi guys so I was on many different anti depressants and never really got any side effects at all. I like to think I'm very strong minded when it comes to taking antidepressants. But when I started on brintillex literally within 5 minutes of me taking it I was getting sick, for the first time ever I was getting a side effect from a pill. I thought maybe I was just sick the first time I took it but every single time I did within 5 minutes I would be getting sick. This happened in the car we would have to pull over this happened in work. I'm not one to give up on something so I said I was going to keep going and push through I stayed on it for over  3 months and it didn't get much better! Such a waste of time and money it cost me a bomb for a box of it I think 70 euro as I don't have a medical card and there was no generic version! Worst antidepressant ever.",1,11,1
"Trintellix","Nurse75","May 12, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I have always suffered from anxiety and depression. Having to go to work as a nurse's not knowing what the next day would bring was making my anxiety out of control.  I went off Wellbutrin, started low dose of Trintellix. The anxiety was quickly gone, but I feel blah, crying al ot, getting depressed easily.  I'm going top try and get back into working out again and see if that helps.",6,7,1
"Trintellix","Kgirl","February 25, 2020","-","I went on this medication because I have a condition called PGAD (persistent genital arousal disorder). The condition I have is absolutely horrible. I was previously on zoloft for over 10 years 100mg. It starts to flatten out so my doctor also gave me Wellbutrin 150mg in 2016/2017. In May 2019 my PGAD condition occurred (reasons are still unknown). I was then told to go off zoloft due to it's sexual side effects and try something else. My doctor gave me Trintellix 10mg. At first it worked okay. I felt super nauseous for a while. Then later almost every night I waa throwing up an hour after taking Trintellix. I took Trintellix for 8 months with zero relief of the vomiting. I have to take domperidone before my trintellix so I don't puke. My condition sort of got better now it is terrible. I also have anxiety and panic attacks nearly every day and cry very easily. It just isn't the pill for me. It was used for my anxiety and did not work.",2,24,1
"Trintellix","Anonymous","February 24, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was on Cipralex for 5 years for anxiety and depression and my anxiety was better but about depression it was up and down, my dr switched me to trintellix 20 about 6 months ago and I feel my depression is getting better. I feel more happy but it worsened my anxiety ! I don't think this drug helps for anxiety at all !!!",2,22,1
"Trintellix","cali999","February 23, 2020","-","Trintellex started working by the end of the second week and continues to.  I am happier than I have ever been and so impressed that Trintellex was able to get me through the incredibly difficult last two months, e.g changed jobs, had a project with an impossible deadline, the holidays, etc.  I'm on 10mg daily.  Side effect-wise  I have some sexual dysfunction (loss of libido, difficult to achieve orgasm) but right now it seems worth it to feel this good.  I've also lost weight. A new wrinkle as of 2 weeks ago is a tinnitus.  I only notice it when its totally quiet which hasn't made sleeping the best so I take Trazadone to help with that which works great.  After two months, I'm still feeling great on the Trintellex but the side effects aren't dissipating and I'm wondering how long I will be able to deal with them.  Definitely not forever.  Will update if things change.",9,36,1
"Trintellix","Blondie","February 19, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started Trintellix at 10mg over 4 weeks ago after being on Prestiq for over a year.  I have been going into a deeper depression then I have ever experienced.  I have sweats, upset stomach (take in morning with food). My nerves are shot and I don't want to leave my bedroom. I used to be so active in life now I just want to hide. I am going to my doctor today to request being taken of this medication and be put on something else.  This medicine has just made my life worse than ever before. If you are deciding on what to go on I would not recommend this product.",1,27,1

Absolutely horrible! I have never felt this crazy. I feel like I am loosing my mind. Constant panic attacks, sensitivity to even the slightest sounds, lightheaded/dizziness, nausea, suicidal ideations, difficulty breathing. I am suffering from severe mood swings. I stopped taking it tonight. Just can’t do it anymore. I rather have nothing than this.",1,24,1

"Trintellix","venommist","January 15, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have update after 13 weeks. So I started Trintellix for MDD/Anxiety/OCD. First 2-3 weeks really fast improvement with my energy and motivation, but after 5 - 6 weeks I had severe headache and cold chills. Took a break for 2-3 days and started again. Motivation again but still not myself.  Couldn't sleep with 10 mg, its really activating, my blood pressure went high, so must cut back to 5 mg, seems its ok, no nausea, less brain fog, better cognition. Keep update next.",7,35,1
"Trintellix","zra","January 7, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I swapped from Cipralex to Trintellix because of the major sexual dysfunction Cipralex caused on me. I've been on 5mg 2 weeks now and after 1,5 weeks I really noticed improvement. At beginning I was feeling nausea all the time and had diarrhea but those went away with time.  My erection is a lot better than it used to and I feel the sense in my penis is also getting better. With Cipralex it was just numb and I had no libido.  After 2 weeks I highly recommend this drug. My anxiety is a lot better but sleeping is still a bit difficult and I need Zopinox to fall asleep, hoping it'll get better too.",7,26,1
"Trintellix","Olive","January 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was really hopeful for Trintellix because within the first few days the brain fog cleared up, which is what motivated my prescriber to get me started on it and switch from Prozac. I was actually doing well on Prozac, except the brain fog. I'm also postpartum, which is known for the brain fog/lack of memory. I've noticed from the reviews this medication either works really well, or sends you down a depression spiral. You either lose weight and appetite or you gain it. Unfortunately, I've experienced the  latter. I am calling tomorrow to get off it. I am angry, sad, hopeless, really hungry, bloated/gassy, lethargic, snappy, poor concentration, itchy.",3,24,1

"Trintellix","L","December 28, 2019","-","When I first started trintellix I went  the dose increases like I should. Started at 5 mg  dose, then 10 mg. No major issues. I noticed the slightest nausea when brushing my teeth, but that was it. I knew to take it on a full stomach so I wouldn’t feel sick. Then it was time to go up to 20 mg. So I did. After a day or so I had strong nausea. So my doctor and I decided to go back to 10 mg as it worked. Few years later and a different doctor, I was feeling more depressed and tried a different drug which didn’t work. So I went back to trintellix. We decided maybe I didn’t have nausea that bad or maybe it was something else. So I switched, started fine on 5 mg and went up to 10 mg with no issues. Went to 15 mg and the depression felt like it was finally under control with only nausea brushing my teeth. Well we decided to go up to 20 mg. And guess what? Nausea. It was so bad today I just had to lay there and take a nap until I felt better. So I guess 15 mg is my sweet spot for this drug.",8,29,1
"Trintellix","Weary","December 13, 2019","-","Trying a med change after being on Effexor + Lamotrigine for 10 years.  I did the very slow weaning off of Effexor and the  2 weeks on 5mg Trintellix to 10mg. The nausea was bad and consistent, though my body is tolerant of just about everything.  I experienced some burping also, which is very unusual for me.  One day I took 10mg Trintellix with Lamotrigine and only coffee.  I have never vomited so violently and for so long.   I experienced nausea for about a half hour almost every time I took the med with food.  Frequently what followed was a gnawing in my stomach that seemed to cause a strong urge to eat protein foods.  I noticed an increase in blunt/abrasive behavior with family and co-workers.  My doc urged me to back down to 5mg and push through the negative symptoms.  The issues persisted over the next two months and my wife repeatedly asked me to change meds.",2,26,1
"Trintellix","Elle","December 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This medication saved my life. I have tried several other drugs which did not help. Wellbutrin was the worst for me, giving me racing and really dark thoughts. Before taking any meds, I had an insane appetite and would wake up starving no matter how much I ate. (In addition to excessive crying, feeling hopeless, not being able to do simple chores like shower). I went a few years suffering like this because I was in denial that I was depressed. Well fast forward a few years later after trying 3 different drugs at different strengths, and Trintellix is the one for me. I never thought I would sleep through the night again. I sleep so soundly now. My appetite is back to normal. My depressive thoughts have been tamed. I am so grateful for this drug and all it has done to improve my quality of life.",10,78,1
"Trintellix","LaurenZzzzz","December 8, 2019","-","Short and sweet— miracle drug for me. I have MDD and anxiety with panic attacks. This medication made me feel like myself again and did not cause any significant side effects. I’m pretty drug naive and I’d never been on a psychiatric drug until now. My life has significantly changed for the best. Please try this drug if you struggle with crippling anxiety that feeds your depression. I started off on a really tiny low dose since I’m super sensitive to medication, and any side effects were tolerable and went away within a week. Give this 2 months to work.",10,64,1

I started having headaches at the 10mg, but I refused to give up. About three weeks later, I really noticed it working and the headaches had gone away. I'm glad I stuck with it!

"Trintellix","Jerseygirl","November 12, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was put on 5mg Trintellix to start  for my depression and it made me feel 10X’s worse. I was suffering with severe migraines that last all day and night basically. I told my husband it felt like I was having a brain aneurysm, on top of that I felt like a zombie. For someone who gets up everyday at 5am it was hard for that to happen definitely a struggle. I haven’t slept in till NOON since I was a teenager and it’s very unusual for that to happen. I would sleep the days away or struggle to function because on the migraines that hurt the whole top of my head and down the right side making everything hurt. I felt more emotional and would cry more basically felt like a feeling of doom. Definitely made my depression worse. So now I’m switching back to Celexa but upping the dose from 10mg-20mg as this seemed to be helping more with less side affects. I wish anyone who tries this the best of luck as I know everyone reacts differently to different meds, but this is definitely not for me.",1,25,2

My doctor suggested Trintellix due to the lack of negative side effects. To my surprise he was right, not only do I not have side effects I can see a noticeable difference in my depression. I no longer suffer from crippling anxiety and depression which prohibited me from accomplishing so much in my life, now I finally have a sense of direction and well I’m content.

I took the drug for 2 years &amp; it probably saved my life. Made a huge difference with mild side effects while on it - until the point I decided to stop the meds. It was affecting my eyes, my blood sugar levels (type 2 diabetic), intense hunger pains, and in general made my body feel unwell. I tapered down for a couple months and then stopped. But everything has a price. Currently I'm suffering from severe discontinuation symptoms. Body shocks, numbness, weakness, twitches, skin sensitivity, etc. It's going on 6 weeks since symptoms appeared but they are lessening. It's been tough. I haven't been able to work, play much with my son, or spend much time with my wife. Overall I'm glad I took Trintellix. It pulled me out of a bad spiral and helped me change the way I think about things. Although coming off might be tough and painful - it stopped me from hurting myself and gave me a better future to look forward to.",7,28,2
"Trintellix","Eagle","October 24, 2019","-","I have had anxiety since I've been 9 years old, I was on Flouvoxamine until the age of 16 and weaned myself off.  A month ago I started getting insane anxiety that would send me into emotional breakdowns. I went to see my doctor and spoke with her about medications and that I was very hesitant as I prefer a natural approach. I was also very concerned about weight gain and loss of libido. She recommended that I try a new drug called Trintellix and that those side effects were not an issue with it. I have been on this medication for a week and I've been crying nearly every night and cannot catch my breath and relax. Although my mental chatter has lessened I'd rather be off the his medication than deal with this awful feeling. I have since today experienced a very persistent headache that is unbearable.  No nausea or stomach upset but I sort of don't want to know what could happen if I were jump to the 10mg from 5mg. Not worth it.",4,18,2

There is a history of depression and bi polar disease in my family.  At the beginning of the summer I felt like I needed some help, I don’t like taking meds but I just wasn’t feeling right.  My therapist recommended a nurse therapist to possibly prescribe something to help my mood.   I met with her and was prescribed Trintellix.  She gave me samples starting with 5 mg a day for one week, increasing the dose to 10 mg there after.     The nausea was horrible, it didn’t make a difference whether I took it with food or not.  My libido sunk to a new low, I had so many GI symptoms including bloating, gas and diarrhea.  I took the med for 6 weeks, The nausea never subsided.  I don’t know whether my depression was any better because I felt so sick.   All I can say is this drug did not work for me, I have never had so many side effects from a medication.",1,25,2

I was considering to stop taking it and I was so negative about the whole thing. I got back to my doctor who told me  You will continue to take it, I want you to be patient . Doctor prescribed me 10mg/day and after another week I saw the first signs of improvement. It took me almost a month to see the first signs of improvement. First thing which this medicine solved was depression, it has just gone away. I’m currently working on my anxiety symptoms. I’ve been taking it for about 7 weeks now.

Things to note: Work amazing on my fatigue and irritability Added benefit of reducing my premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms. My husband thanks you!  I have been on it for just over 6 months and some of the positive effects are wearing off.  I tried increasing the dose to 10 mg but I am very sensitive to drugs and the added kick meant I could not sleep at night. Was like drinking a coffee!  Seem to be easier to take in the morning for me - less nausea. I will say, I do think it makes my car sickness worse. Travelling to the cottage is a lot less enjoyable.",7,19,2

It helped the anxiety, but not the depression. I asked about trintellix and was then prescribed it. I could tell a major difference with just 3 days of taking the medication!! So far no side affects, I sleep way less (could sleep a total of 12-15 hours), feel much more happier, more willing to do basic chores, errands, WORK, and the anxiety is suppressed. I just want to say that so far this medication has been life changing for me.

I gave it 60 days...HUGE mistake.  My depression was off the charts, panic, mania, brain fog, INSOMNIA was so bad (had to take Ambien another awful drug), constipation and ZERO appetite (lost 25 lbs in 30 days).  I quit the 10 mg (could not tolerate 20mg) cold turkey.  I was able to eat/sleep almost immediately, however, the anxiety and brain fog hasn’t lifted after 6 weeks.

I am about to go up to 20mg starting tomorrow because my OCD and anxiety are still there (though less), but as of now I can say that I feel a lot better mentally as far as mood and depression goes. I guess I am the lucky one as this causes almost no side effects as far as nausea and stomach cramps, other than constipation and a bit of dizziness/shaking and tremors the first few weeks, which are currently weaning away.

There are many other factors, but in a nutshell, I think I overloaded myself. I went to the dr for something for anxiety. He gave me trintellix instead, which initially made me angry because I didn’t consider myself to be depressed and felt written off. However, within 3 days of taking this medication, I could tell a major difference. I really did not expect this to work for me at all, and I’m so thankful I tried it anyway.

My depression was never overwhelming sadness, it was quite the opposite: I felt nothing. Nothing gave my pleasure. I was just a robot doing what I had to do. It worked quite quickly, about 3 weeks after I started. I will always have depression, but I'm able to cope now. I no longer feel like life is meaningless.. I now do things just for the sake of it.

I didn't really experience any side effects and eventually titrated up to 20mg per day. After almost a year at this dose, I still haven't experienced any side effects, find that my sexual response is uninhibited, and there has been no poop-out.

I was always tired, always taking naps and still going to bed early. With Brintellix, the fatigue is GONE!

A week ago I requested help from my physician due to the increasing depression and lack of help from Cymbalta he prescribed Brintellix.  I switched immediately and some of the symptoms are withdrawal from the Cymbalta.  The  reverberations in my head are distinctly withdrawal symptoms.  My headaches appear to be from decreased sodium which is a Brintellix side effect and for me are eliminated by drinking Gatorade which is high in sodium.

I also take Trileptol, Tramadol, Norco, gabapentin, and two inhalers. I'm 33 and have some health issues and so far the medicine seems to be helping. I just hope it stays this way. Good luck to everyone.",8,63,21
"Trintellix","Anonymous","March 5, 2014","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on Brintellix for nearly six weeks.  I experienced severe nausea for the first 10 days but thankfully it subsided after that time.  The medicine has mellowed me out but I still feel very zoned out, tired and listless.  I don't have a joy for life with this medicine that I experienced on another antidepressant in the past.   My major concern is an increase in blood pressure.  I am an extremely healthy 35 year old female whose blood pressure has ALWAYS been 110/70.  Since starting this medication, my blood pressure has gone from 110/70 to 120/82, then 139 over 74 and now 149 over 80.  Nothing has changed in the past six weeks other than the addition of the medicine.  I'm hoping to find something that is going to work soon.",3,70,21
"Trintellix","Sennerin","February 28, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been taken 10 mg for 3 weeks. I have taken other anti depressants before with very little to no help. With this one I feel a lot better, I have more energy, I can focus and concentrate better. My mind is clearer than it has been for a long time and I am happier. So far I have no side effects besides I am a little constipated.",9,132,21
"Trintellix","MoodyMama67","February 20, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","I have been on Brintellix 10 mg and increased to 20 mg on 02/19/2014. I have experienced dry mouth, dizziness, forgetfulness, no desire to eat, weight loss of 11 lbs in 10 days, which is good considering I'm overweight, this can't be a bad thing, and wake up often, however, I am in a happier mood and not so stressed out. I have been on Brintellix for a total of 11 days. Hope the yucky side effects go away soon. I have tried almost everything else and nothing has worked mood wise for me as good as this is.",8,136,21
"Trintellix","desss","February 15, 2014","-","I have been taking 20 mg for about 1 month. I feel awesome. I have taken everything you can imagine and no success. I take this along with 3 other medicines. I have energy and no side effects. I couldn't be happier. I hope it stays this way. I was at a horrible place and now have hope.",9,222,21
"Trintellix","cantbshaken","February 12, 2014","Taken for less than 1 month","This is day 5 for me, so far no major side effects. A little dizziness the first day I took it. Hoping this is the one for me. Tried 4 other medications 2 SSRIs and 2 SNRIs, had troubles with side effects. Brintellix has been the easiest for my body to adjust to just praying that it works for anxiety.",0,23,21

"Trintellix","SALosangeles","February 3, 2014","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on 10mg it for 8 weeks and it works well for me. I did not want to go up to 20mg but I was going through some ups and downs so my Dr. recommended I go up to 20mg.  This is my 4 day on it and seems to be working better. I did not have any sexual side effects or notifiable weight gain but I do seem to have some tingling sensation in my head.  This is my first time on Antidepressants.",8,88,21
"Trintellix","frannigan","January 8, 2014","-","I was so hopeful for this to work but I had an allergic reaction after 18 days, face tingling, agitation, chills, fever. Had to discontinue and now feel terrible withdrawals fever, chills after stopping. I hope others have phenomenal success though. I'm just sensitive to medicines.",2,87,21
"Trintellix","Johncriley","November 25, 2013","-","So far so good, minimal sexual side effects and I don't feel zoned out like I have on other antidepressants. Still only on ten mg will go up in a few weeks. This is week 2.5 for me.",7,104,22

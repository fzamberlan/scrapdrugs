"Risperidone","Teetee","February 18, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have never felt mentally ill before taking this medication. It ruined my life for the 3 months I took it, my anxiety was through the roof, mood was very low every day, crying all the time... just very bad. I am not an anxious person but this really become some depressed anxious mess that I did not recognise",1,6,1
"Risperidone","ingridn","January 19, 2020","-","I have MDD. I was prescribed 0.25mg risperidone that evolved to 0.5mg and 15mg escitalopram. Risperidone was supposed to augment the effects of escitalopram and help me sleep - light sleep, difficulty to fall asleep. I report the effects of rispiridone assuming that the change in the mood (improved) is due to escitalopram. It helps me lots! I didn't know I slept so badly. Finally my nights recharge my batteries. I didn't gain weight or had an increase in my appetite. I run 40min/day + care about what I eat. I did it before, and kept doing it. I even lost 2kg that I wanted for some time (controlling the diet). I changed from escitalopram to bupropion (150mg) due to side effects, and considered stopping risperidone. I did it for 2 nights, but no good. Now I'm with 150mg bupropion-morning and 0.5mg risperidone-evening. It's so good to feel like a normal person again! But therapy is as important for me as I managed to understand my dysfunctional behaviour that (I believe) led me to MDD.",10,6,1
"Risperidone","drake","January 9, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","So I was admitted to the psychiatric ward of an Indian hospital; I’m an Indian male; and was given this drug risperidone to help me with psychosis. The first few days were a nightmare. I was restless and I wanted to move all the time. I gained weight on my legs during the second week. I felt lethargic throughout. I was put on 8mg of liquid and felt absolutely horrible. The feeling was so bad that I can’t even describe it. But my mind was being put under control. The audiovisual hallucinations were disappearing fast. I have to admit that after eight months and after being put on 2mg, my psychosis has vanished. Yet the hallucinations were not the problem anymore- the inactivity, laziness, lethargic feeling were. I’ve got three months left and I’m so used to doing nothing that I wonder whether I’ll be able to move again. I’m always on my bed!",1,8,1

"Risperidone","Jaz","December 19, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug made me develop depression which I didn’t have prior just really bad anxiety also gave me intrusive thoughts had me very suicidal.

"Risperidone","Yellowsun","November 14, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been on this drug risperidone for maybe a month and it helps a lot with my anxiety, but I still get anxious when I think about/are in social situations. My depression is manageable and I'm having less suicidal thoughts! I have a healthy appetite though, I need to go weigh myself to see if I've gained any weight. I take 1 mg during the day and 1 mg at night.",8,9,1
"Risperidone","Anonymous","November 9, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug ruined my life. I was depressed before taking it, but when I was on it I had terrible suicidal thoughts that I didn't  used to have before this. I couldn't sleep and developed terrible anxiety attacks. Another side effect that I experienced was high prolactin levels which led to amenorrhea and a full face full of horrible acne (I'm not exaggerating). This of course made me more depressed and socially anxious. Coming off of it was as bad as being on the drug. Two weeks off of it, I am still experiencing the side effects of this drug, although i can at least sleep now. I'm absolutely miserable thanks to risperidone. Stay away from this drug!!!!!!!!!",1,7,1
"Risperidone","JP","October 18, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I suffered from acute insomnia and depression due to trauma, and was put on this risperidone  by a psychiatrist. Got my first dose just before bedtime, and woke up at midnight with the most terrible panic attack (first time in my life). The panic attack basically lasted until the evening of the following day, varying in intensity. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. The psychiatrist changed my prescription to Serequel (Quetiapine), which agreed much better with me. I used it for about 2 years until my circumstances improved, and has been off all medication for 7 years now.  I have never before or since had a panic or anxiety attack, so this was definitely due to the medication. I was told it was a very low percentage side effect.",1,6,1
"Risperidone","asantha","August 28, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I am taking 0.5 mg risperidone with 0.25mg clonazipam for my insomnia, anxiety and depression it woks me well and I take 30mg of ritalin in the morning and 20mg of fluxetine in the evening for my ADHD and OCD this combinations of medicine very well nice feeling to me",10,7,1
"Risperidone","drew","August 15, 2019","-","I'm actually on this for pschosis. Risperidone has some terrible side effects. For example, I’m remembering the negatives of my past and cannot control those memories. I don’t like getting up mornings and I’ve got a horrible feeling in my body, in my stomach.  On the other hand, I’m doing very well- no more hallucinations, no more silly thoughts against family, no more  racing  thoughts (as someone else put it). I am much better yet my past is haunting me. Thanks a lot to the psychiatrists for asking me to take this medication. But I cannot wait to get off it! I have three months to go; doctors said  six months to one year . I hope the doctor says six months in total is OK. I cannot take it for more than six months because it also affects my study and work. I am extremely tired and have been lying down on my bed staring at the ceiling for three months. I want to get off it even though I am feeling much better. Yes, it makes you gain weight, enlarged breasts for men, and slight blurry vision.",5,13,1
"Risperidone","pnc","July 12, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Nefarious medication. My depression worsened due to the fact that my concentration capacity decreased drastically. Not to mention diarrhea and the highest prolactin. On the other hand it is confirmed that risperidone shrinks the volume of the brain, my psychiatrist did not deny it.",1,7,1
"Risperidone","obscure","May 23, 2019","-","Been on Risperidone LS 3mg for a year for Manic Depression. I also take lithium and an antidepressant. I tried quetipine but it made me sleep all day long. Risperidon has got rid of my suicidal thoughts, manic episodes and constant self talk/conversations. The only weird side effect is that I have these very long lasting ultra realistic dreams. It's almost like you are still awake. Unfortunately all I have are major nightmares since the past 20 years or so. And now they are very very real.",9,6,1
"Risperidone","Thatmans","May 18, 2019","-","I don’t like and I do like respiridone. It helped me with some anxiety and some depression but I would always be drowsy and normally completely emotionless. But I hated feeling sleepy so I stopped taking them and my body didn’t like having to naturally deal with emotions and depression so then I went into a deep depression but natural remedies for depression are a lot better than respiridone.",4,3,1
"Risperidone","Thanks Risperidone...NOT","January 7, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was on risperdal 0.5 mg for 1 month, and 1 mg for 2 months.  I was told to stop cold turkey on 11-16-2018 because it didn’t seem to help with the depression.  It was prescribed as an add on therapy to Wellbutrin.  2 days later I started having severe anxiety and panic attacks.  I mean SEVERE.  I had not had anxiety before this!  Now, Jan 2019 I am still having these affects and am on benzodiazepine’s for the anxiety.  No help PLUS they make me feel like a zombie.  DO NOT TAKE RISPERIDONE!",1,7,1

"Risperidone","Anonymous","February 27, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","This medication is amazing. It helped with my major depressive episode along with my panic and ocd. I feel like myself again. It did take 2-4 weeks to fully work but honestly the wait is worth it. I feel more balanced and I’m able to control my thoughts.",9,14,1
"Risperidone","crashtestchristy","February 12, 2018","-","I've been taking risperidone for about a year and a half now.  I take 1 mg at night and 0.5 mg as needed in the morning. It has been amazing. I have major depressive disorder and severe generalized anxiety. I've tried tons of different antidepressants over the years with no working results. Trying risperidone was like night and day immediately. For the first time, my head was clear of miserable intrusive thoughts and my anxiety levels were much lower, albeit still there. It does not make me sleepy and I have not put on any weight. I sometimes have trouble losing weight but I think that is more due to my lack of commitment than the medication. My sex drive has been significantly reduced but I think the trade-off is worth it.",10,21,1
"Risperidone","Nothingworks","July 5, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","Bad experience. Psych used it to 'augment' mirtazapine.

"Risperidone","Anxietygirl74","May 19, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have OCD, GAD, panic attacks, depression. I was on respirdone several years ago at 2 mg and then 3 mg, and it worked great. I forget why I was taken off of it, but a little over a month ago, I was put back on it; however, I had to switch to name brand then because the generic of Risperdal was making me not be able to think and almost be in a trance. Now I am on 1 mg of brand name risperdal and it works very well for alll these problems (I also am on some other meds with it) but especially my OCD.",10,22,2
"Risperidone","Farris The Saint","February 3, 2016","-","I have been taking risperdal for 7 years now. The worst thing about it is the lack of motivation and the carelessness. I don't feel like waking up because I have no interest in life any more. I wake up when I feel like I have slept too much. I can't work on my projects (I am a web developer) I have no interest in working because I don't feel motivated and I feel tired after I work instead of satisfied. My sex drive has gone down dramatically. The best thing about this drug is that it doesn't make me feel down or sad all the time, in fact, I don't feel anything any more like a zombie, a living dead if you well. Don't take it unless you have to",4,37,2
"Risperidone","silentsirens","September 2, 2015","-","my experience with risperdal started when I first started seeing my psychiatrist for about a year now. I first started with 1 mg for two weeks and then started taking 2 mg for a month, and then three for another month before my doctor prescribed me 4 mg for a month which I didn't finish because it was intense for me and it made me really somnolent and overall sleepy all the time. my mom asked him to get me back on 3 mg which I've been on for seven months now. the only flaw that this medication has is that it causes some severe weight gain, and I can't sleep without it. risperdal has initially helped with my bipolar depression, and has successfully put my racing thoughts to rest.",8,23,2
"Risperidone","violet33","October 9, 2014","-","I've been of risperidone for about 2-3 years and now I have a prolactinoma. It could be a coincidence -- although I know risperidone is notorious for causing high prolactin. As for any other side effects, I didn't experience any. I'm having a hard time getting off of this medication now that the doctor told me to stop taking it, because I can't sleep without it.",6,30,2
"Risperidone","invisible_creeper","July 21, 2014","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've taken Risperdal for about 6 years to deal with depression and suicidal/self-injurous thoughts. It works very well for this. The only problem is that it does cause very severe weight gain, to the point where if I consume less than 1,400 calories a day I STILL gain weight. I have recently started taking Topamax to offset this, so hopefully this will help. But it does help immensely with problematic thoughts and I notice a huge difference in my state of mind and overall well being when I take Risperdal. Additionally it offers the great benefit of helping me fall asleep, which is great as a long-time insomniac. Overall a great drug, just some problematic side effects.",8,32,2

"Risperidone","gigimac","April 8, 2013","Taken for 1 to 6 months","After getting used to the medicine, which took a couple of weeks of confusion, I began to realize my problems with 35 years of depression, especially bad in the last five years, went away like magic!  My focus also improved.  I cannot tell you how good it feels not to go to those deep, dark thoughts, lack of motivation, and an I don't care attitude.  Being able to stay present in a pleasant world I had missed for so long is a wonder, and I had no idea it treated depression.  The only problem I have with it is, it makes the muscles in my legs, both above and below the knees, to hurt quite a bit.  If the makers ever go back to tinkering with its chemistry, stopping the pain would be smart,  with a super-low start dose recommended.",9,96,2
"Risperidone","Valenciana","January 10, 2012","-","I use this medicine for self-harming thoughts. I take 1.5 mg and it does help a lot. My self-harming thoughts have less power and stick less when I'm taking this medication. However, I have gained a lot of weight. I eat pretty healthily, exercise 2 to 3 times per week, and I'm only 17, but I've gone from 130 pounds to 180 pounds after taking this medicine for 3 and a half years. Another side effect is very vivid dreams that occur every night, but this isn't a problem. I also stopped getting my period for about a year and a half; however, that could have been due to self-starvation, since it has come back now (the medication is also lower than it has been).",8,35,2

Although similar to moving into a new house, it was easy to get used to it and greatly simplified daily routine for the most part. Does not help with PMS associated lack of concentration but enhances concentration overall at this low dosage and makes it easy to focus on relationship problems also, although no drug can change the other person.",0,63,2

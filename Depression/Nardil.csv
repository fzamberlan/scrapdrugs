The side effects  of nardil are not good, but at least I am alive and functioning. The worst aspect of the med? You never know when the manufacturer is going to get behind making it. Once it was due to a worker strike.",10,2,1
"Nardil","Angel","May 1, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Nardil changed my life. I have tried almost every SSRI, SNRI, the atypicals and buspirone, etc for social anxiety disorder. They don't come close to Nardil. I have atypical depression, social anxiety, GAD, and ADD. The side effects are low blood pressure and insomnia. Easily treated with meds. I have tried everything on the banned food list and never had any slight increase whatsoever in BP. I am convinced the tyramine thing is just an old myth. When I first tried Nardil it was like a light came on after living my whole life in the dark. I will be on this med for the rest of my life as long as they keep making it.",10,10,1
"Nardil","KimD","April 29, 2020","-","I have been on Nardil for thirty years due to a bad period in my marriage that brought on my panic disorder again and depression.   I started on three, fifteen mg tablets per day and reduced this dose to two 15mg tablets over the course of one year over ten years ago. During the Covid 19 crisis, I have found it increasingly difficult to obtain Nardil and, when left with sixteen tablets and the possibility of not obtaining more, I reduced the dose from two tablets per day to one over the course of two weeks.  At first I suffered only sleeplessness but then itching all over and tiredness began throughout the day.  I have managed to obtain more Nardil but at greater cost and these come from overseas .  Mentally I feel fine but physically awful.  A general practitioner I saw once told me that Nardil my have taken over my Serotonin production.  Can anyone tell me if my Serotonin will bounce back to normal or am I destined to be on this pill forever?",10,6,1
"Nardil","Adrian","April 28, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","My 22 year old son tried over a dozen antidepressants without getting relief from debilitating depression with suicidal thoughts.  He also tried TMS and Ketamine infusions with no relief. He had almost immediate relief from his symptoms from Nardil 30 mg twice a day.  He also takes Seroquel at night to aid sleeping and relieve anxiety.  This medication saved my son’s life. We have not had trouble getting it here (Wisconsin), thus far.

I had two doctors who tried to treat me with antidepressants and this failed miserably. I was fortunate enough to find a psychiatrist who prescribed Nardil. Within a month I was feeling better. I have continued to have a wonderful life on this medication. I now find myself with a prescription for Nardil but unable to locate any in Canada at pharmacies or on line. Please advise if you can help me find Nardil.",10,8,1

"Nardil","Tuco","March 30, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","In 1986 while separated from my wife, I gradually fell into a black hole marked by anxiety, obsessive self-accusing thoughts, and suicidal ideation. I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Desyrel, which did nothing.  I went to another psychiatrist. This one prescribed imiprimine. No good. Then we tried desiprimine among others. Nothing. Meanwhile I went to the library and did research on atypical depressions. There was no internet then. I asked for a script for Nardil. He was wary of prescribing it and prescribed something else. Again no good. The next time I almost begged to try it, and he agreed. About four or five days later the clouds lifted and the sun came out. I have never experienced a miracle, but Nardil comes close. The obsessive thoughts stopped. So did the guilt, the feelings of self-worthlessness, the suicidal ideation, and the anhedonia. All gone. Nardil probably saved my life. It was wonderful beyond description.",10,13,1

GP told to cut remaining tablets in half. Went from 45mg a day to 7mg a day. For the last 4 weeks been on no tablets. I am sleeping very well. My mood is ok. Finding it hard sometimes to motivate myself to do stuff at home but still working. The worst thing is the nausea! My real concern that my mood has not dropped significantly. Does this mean that having taken this drug for 17 years that the chemicals are still in my body long after the recommended  washout  period. Haven’t eaten any banned foods. Bit scared to try.

However, I asked her to refer me to a psychiatrist ASAP, &amp; got a private appointment within three days, Nardil IS available, I was sent a 3 month supply by courier, the problem is that neither the NHS or BUPA will pay, fortunately I’m able to. IMO this was not handled well, &amp; I was not going to go through a Wash-Out suffer symptoms etc when it wasn't necessary.

On Oct 11th I went to collect my prescription as normal. I was told there were no supplies. At this point I had enough for a further 4 days but knew I couldn’t just stop them. The next few days were spent in a state of absolute panic, especially when I discovered that a directive had gone out in July to all NHS trusts in the UK, warning them of the forthcoming shortages. When I queried this with the GP and asked why I’d never been warned he turned quite nasty and couldn’t answer.  I had about 100 people (family, friends and Facebook) searching for Phenelzine for the next few days. Despite asking the GP to obtain unlicensed imports (as recommended by SPS to NHS) he categorically refused. Eventually, my husband found a chemist who could get unlicensed imports and that’s how we eventually obtained them. I’m disgusted with my GP surgery for not giving me any warning.",10,25,1

I’ve lived on it very well for 22 years.   I recently tried a newer antidepressant on the market named Trintellix.  I had awful  side effects and lost 14 of my 132 lbs within an 8 week period.  I couldn’t even get to the 20mg therapeutic dose due to side effects.  Started to decrease dose to go back on Nardil, which  required taking nothing for 2 weeks.  I got suicidal and ended up in the hospital.    Started Nardil 5 days ago and am already feeling better.  Not where I was before I got off, but hopeful I’ll soon get my life back.  I just hope it restores my appetite! I’d prefer to be on a  safer  drug but considering I lived a decent life for 22 years on Nardil vs 2 1/2 months of hell while off,  I’m glad to be back on.

Once when I wanted to become pregnant and was told Nardil wasn't safe. Rubbish! Attempting to come off sent me into severe clinical depression and hospitalisation. Went back on Nardil; became pregnant, had my son, who is now 16. When I tried to get my Nardil from GP yesterday, was told that there are no stocks in UK and won't be for at least 2 months. How can this situation have arisen? This turned me virtually suicidal in an instant. Have managed to get Nardil from Canada on private prescription (no thanks to NHS, who have known about the shortage since April but refuse to do anything about it, unlike Australian medical service). Expensive, but I would pay anything to get it. Pharmacists know how to get it like this. I'm now panicking at the thought of Nardil being discontinued - that would be so hard on me.",10,32,1

I never had problems with the food restrictions. There's a shorter list out now that's more accurate. I was never a drinker, so I didn't miss that. You can't take cold medicines, but that's a small price to pay if you're really suffering from depression. I went off of it after 7 years due to side effects of weight gain and edema in both legs. This might have been managed by sticking to a low-carb diet and not giving in to sugar cravings. (Note on withdrawal: I had incredibly vivid, terrible nightmares when withdrawing. Adding Clonazepam shut them down.) I'm now trying to get back on Nardil. Unfortunately my old psychiatrist retired, and I'm having a hard time finding a new one who will prescribe it.

"Nardil","Old and Grey","September 28, 2016","-","I've struggled with depression and social anxiety all my life and have recently been treated with a variety of different antidepressants. I think I am depressed because of a narsisstic mother who seemed to be unable to love unconditionally. While Nardil might well help others, I don't feel it has helped me and the effect on sexual activity it depressing in itself. I am currently seeing a psychotherapist and while it is very hard to deal with the issues that come up, I think it might be my salvation. I do hope so.",3,21,3
"Nardil","Navyman94","August 13, 2016","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Tried so many anti depressants from 1982 to present then finally looked up Nardil and asked my provider to please please try it as i am tired of going back and forth on the Old and the new medications.  Started the titrade from 25 mg daily and up to 45mg twice daily with such a relief from years of depression and anxiety after diagnosed with PTSD. Felt best at the 90mg daily but now i notice the feeling is fading and I am wondering if the new batches are No good.  I speak of food for myself as i eat anything that i want and have not experienced any negative feeling. Weight gain is a real negative especially in my gut and i can seem to get rid of it.",9,38,3

The dietary restrictions were less difficult to get used to and less strict than they appeared at first. I was on 30mg of Nardil a day and didn't notice any effect, but after increasing to 45mg/day, I felt the best I've felt in years and it seemed that my depression might be cured at last. ...however, I also had the most side effects I've ever had from a medication: constipation, difficulty urinating, insomnia, and inability to reach an orgasm. Because of the bladder issues and insomnia, I've been forced to resume my search.",6,27,3

It can be annoying when you have a cold or flu but at least don't  get depressed about it. Lol. Good thing the psychiatrist gave me that first so I didn't have to try others. I tell others about it so they can get their severe anxiety helped.",10,65,3

"Nardil","Bipolar12345","March 8, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Nardil works very well for my bipolar depression. I had hypersomnia when I was depressed and the drugs I tried (Lamictal, Zoloft, Celexa…) didn’t help at all. I’m glad my psychiatrist made me try this medication.  At first, I took 45 mg, but after a while, it made me maniac. I had to lower the dosage to 30 mg and, surprisingly, it’s seems to be working (even though it’s not considered as a therapeutic dose). The diet is very easy to follow, as long as you can take bottled beer. The only downside is the sugar cravings, which are difficult to resist.",9,44,3

Was not hospitalized as I tried tricyclic after tricyclic, with the awful side effects, weight gain and almost a zombie, sleeping all the time. Researching I discovered MAOI Inhibitors, was put on Nardil.  Had only 15 min. medication checks every two weeks.  At the first I asked, still depressed, Will I ever be motivated again?, so weary was I of this horrid depression. At the second medication check, two weeks later, my depression had lifted!  It kept me out of depression, functioning, and as close to 'normal', whatever that is, for decades.  It saved my life.",10,109,3

My doctor is going to start getting me off it soon as he will try Nortripyline. It's true that Nardil works for a lot of people but not me.  Just a terrible experience.",0,46,3

The only one that ever worked is Nardil. I am 33 years old now and would recommend this monoamine oxidase inhibitor to everyone who needs to be on an antidepressant.  I was fortunate to find a very  intelligent doctor who worked with me through these years.  He told me not too many doctors prescribe Nardil for the food restrictions or whatever, but I personally believe the old school MAOI's are the way to go. Nardil gets a 10 in my book.  I felt the ahhh, effects after one week.",10,111,3

Nardil turned my life around, I was like a new person: talkative, extroverted, able to feel at-ease and laugh, make jokes, fully calm and relaxed, AND happy! I was finally the person I was always meant to be. I can say it truly saved my life. Side-effects DO lessen and even disappear, so be patient.

I also have high blood pressure so phenelzine was thought not to be a good choice, however it stabilized my blood pressure that I have now been able to stop taking medication to control it. It is an old fashioned medicine, there are dietary restrictions but you get used to them. Just as diabetics get used to their dietary restrictions and it is a very small price to pay for peace of mind.

I am a senior citizen and at times it does concern me about continuing the Nardil, but as long as it keeps working and I see my psychiatrist regularly, I have faith I will be okay.  Sure, I have a few down days here and there, but never like it was before I was put on Nardil long ago.

"Methylphenidate","DJ","November 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was diagnosed several years ago with treatment-resistant depression. I have been on all of the antidepre ssant and anti-anxiety medications available today, with not a single one of them helping my depression the least little bit. Finally my doctor agreed to prescribe this medication methylphenidate about a  month ago.  It has been an absolute godsend. I would go as far as to say it has probably saved my life, as I was suicidal nearly every day before I began taking it.",10,42,1
"Methylphenidate","Mack","November 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have bipolar disorder and ADHD. I was put on this medication to treat the ADHD, but I’ve noticed a significant difference in my depressive episodes when I take Ritalin. Before, when I experienced my  lows,  I wouldn’t be able to get out of bed, I couldn’t concentrate, my mind was foggy, I’d binge eat, put things off, and was miserable 24/7. Ritalin helps me focus, complete tasks, start my day, eat properly, and minimizes the depressive emotions in general. As of five months on the medication, I’ve watched it successfully treat the ADHD and fight back depression symptoms. I just want to clarify it doesn’t get rid of depression, but it does make it manageable. I am under the care of a psychiatrist, and we are monitoring the effects of Ritalin on both my ADHD and mood swings.",8,19,1

Before being back on Ritalin I had actually been battling SEVERE suicidal attempts since my son passed away. And when I'm on my medicine I'm also able to concentrate wonderfully.     The most important thing is that my depression is now very minimal, sometimes almost non-existent, and also can speak and think clearly again. Thank God for this medication.",10,24,1
"Methylphenidate","Susi","September 25, 2019","-","I have treatment resistant depression on and off for past 6 years. I never had a history of depression until these episodes started at age 54. I have had 3 major episodes where I had to take a LOA from work for 4 months while the Psychiatrist tried every medication cocktail. Finally Abilify brought me back to life the first time. The next episode was Methylphenidate was ineffective but I don’t think I have it a chance. The third episode was 2 years ago and Methylphenidate gave me my joy and allowed me to engage in life again. I am worried about the long term effects of being on this drug as it is going on 3 years. It has become less effective with time. I can tell when it’s time to take my next immediate release dose.",0,18,1
"Methylphenidate","LabLover","August 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Bipolar 2 for 30 years with depressive phase being treatment resistant. Have tried many many anti-depressants and mood stabilizers, as well as ECT. My Psychiatrist finally prescribed Adderall 30mg to my current regime Zoloft 300, Latuda 40, Epival 1000, Lithium 900. I felt the effects of Adderall within a couple of hours and had the most productive and pleasant day in over a year. I didn't feel too hyped up, and I was able to sleep. ( I made sure I gave myself enough wind down time and self care.) It is an appetite suppressant for sure, but mostly just makes me take the time to make better food choices. Hope that helps, it is certainly helping me.",9,24,1

"Methylphenidate","Mike","July 6, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Methylphenidate works well to help elevate my symptoms of depression. I’m calm and focused while on the medication. It has also helped my anxiety by eliminating racing thoughts and rumination. It allows me to cope with stress a lot better. I am able to focus on an issue, task or problem and deal with it appropriately. Whereas off the med I would get overwhelmed and start becoming stressed. I highly recommend it for someone with ADHD, anxiety and/or mild depression.  I also take Benadryl at night to help me sleep. This combination has really helped me out. Please talk to your doctor before taking this medication  if you have Major Depressive Disorder.",10,32,1

I has helped decrease anxiety and stress. I don’t feel overwhelmed and depressed. This is in addition go it helping my ADHD. Absolutely no crash on the extended release. I don’t even know I’m on it.. other than I’m more relaxed. I would definitely recommend some trying this medication for anxiety and depression. It has changed my life.",0,21,1

I'm more confident, outgoing, and am able to get engaged in everyday activities.  SSRIs have no positive effects for me. I think Ritalin is as good as it's going to get.

"Methylphenidate","ScruffDaPup","March 10, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","This medication and the people who fought for me to get it saved my life.  I have had treatment-resistant depression for my entire adult life and have had SSRI after SSRI thrown at me but they always made things worse.  This, from the very first dose, made me feel like what normal people must feel like.  It gives me a steady level of energy, the ability to see humans without running home to cry, and took away that urge to throw myself in front of a train.  All with no side effects!  I never feel high or jumpy, just ok--which is amazing for me.  This needs to be approved by the FDA for depression--it could literally save lives.  (Please note--the issues with generics are REAL for this drug.  The yellow KVK brand in particular is like taking nothing.  I have had a month of despair because of them!)",10,42,1

I take two 10 mg in AM and 1 around 5-6 PM.

I Was put on vyvanse, concerta, strattera, and finally back on Ritalin IR 20mg a day. It helped but didn't get me thru the day, started taking 20mg 2x a day, noticed my depressive episodes went away faster, wouldn't sleep 20+ hours when I was down, I could actually get up and go to work. Kept me out of my own head and dark thoughts, it just helps get me out of my funk. No longer fall asleep on the long ride home from work, can be more social, no longer think people are out to cause me harm. Yeah I still get in my funks but the hopelessness doesn't last as long. Truly is a Godsend for me and I thank my wife (soon to be ex) for reintroducing this to me. I also thankful that I had the time I did with her!

Zoloft helps my depression. When I was off it, I was miserable and couldn't get out of bed. I'm on it now and staying on it. For anxiety I've tried Ativan, works well, but because of the horrors of addiction and coming off them, I only take them when things are out of my control e.g. sudden death in the family or I think I may end up in the ED again, because of anxiety. I've had Endep, didn't work. Parnate, anxiety was through the roof, my mind was a mess and bad headaches. I tried Pristiq. No sleep at all, constipation, headaches and was so tired I wanted to cry.  It didn't help my anxiety at all.  My psychiatrist gave me a script for Concerta (slow release) 18 mg. One a day, early morning. I took it this morning, expecting all sorts of side effects.

It turns out it is ADHD and Ritalin helps with ADHD. So if ADHD is the cause of your depression, Ritalin is the med for you. I other words, I would suggest that all those with a depression who are helped by Methylphenidate like for instance Ritalin see a licensed psychiatrist and check for ADHD.

I've only been on it 2 weeks and my shrink says it needs 6 weeks to get into my system but all my research points to a stimulant working within hours . I'm on 10mg 3 x a day and all it does is make me sleep! Not very stimulating! This dose seems to work for most people, maybe I need a bigger dose but overall so far I feel worse because I hardly have the energy to get out of bed and I feel more stimulated by caffeine, side effects for me were intense headaches and nausea, lack of appetite.",1,9,1
"Methylphenidate","punkpsychiatry","June 7, 2017","-","I started taking Ritalin about three months ago for my treatment-resistant depression, and it's been absolutely great, better than any antidepressant I've had so far (SSRIs, tricyclics etc). I take one 10mg pill in the morning, in combination with one 150mg Bupropion. This has been a pretty good combination, and very unusual here in Australia, since neither of these drugs are used to treat depression here, so I have a private script and use them off-label. I'm so glad my psychiatrist put me on to Ritalin, it just makes me come alive. Originally, I was to take it off-and-on on 'busy days' for energy, but now I take it everyday.

Even this combination doesn't always work--usually the citalopram stops working after a number of months, and I have to switch it out for sertraline. A few years ago, my psychiatrist tried adding 20 mg of methylphenidate twice a day.  What a difference!  I am now able to get out of bed, work, focus, smile, and have something that approximates a normal life.

I asked my oncologist about ritalin and he put me on 20mg 3 times a day.  I had no idea how well it cured my depression as well as kept me going through out the day without feeling tired at all!

Methylin ER is truly amazing and I'll never go back to an antidepressant as long as this keeps working.",0,262,3

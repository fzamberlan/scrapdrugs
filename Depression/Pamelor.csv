"Pamelor","Violet5401","February 18, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I had been taking Trintellix for a couple years with success until eventually my anxiety/depression started to creep back. My doctor added 75 mg of nortriptyline every day and I swear I felt major relief in just 3 days. I have been on the Trintellix/Pamelor combo now for over a year. No side effects, and the Pamelor is cheap. As an added bonus, I have chronic hip pain due to bursitis and the pain has almost completely gone away. I am so thankful for this medicine, it has truly helped me.",10,18,1

"Pamelor","Suzy","September 4, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","25 years ago. I took Pamelor for post partum depression. It worked for the depression but had to stop taking because my stools became hard as rocks &amp; were difficult to pass.  I have had irritable bowel syndrome since as a result.  I also gained about 40 pounds &amp; no matter how much I diet or exercise, I cannot lose the weight.",2,23,1

"Pamelor","lildude","May 30, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Pamelor takes solid 2 month to start working. The best medication ever. Less than 1 dollar for pack of 100  tablets of 25mg where I live.",10,28,1
"Pamelor","theskysnotabove","January 8, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I was tried on this for major depression. After 2 weeks on 50mg per night, I couldn't handle it any more. I ended up going to the ER because my heart was racing. I was at 125/130 beats per min. I'd only been getting a few hours of sleep each night in those 2 weeks, and experienced the heart racing, brain short circuits, insomnia, anxiety, severe constipation, extreme thirst, and an overall feeling of disconnect from aliveness.  As a teenager, I took Doxepin and Elavil too, and they were slightly better, but not much. These TCAs should be a last resort like Thorazine and Lithium. Seroquel is much better. Good luck to my fellow sufferers!",1,23,1

It did not help much for that condition.However, at the time I was suffering from severe depression due to having to place my husband in a nursing home.

"Doxepin","Leftyhag","October 20, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","One year ago I had L2L3L4 screwed together.  I was told  there is no reason why I should not get out of bed and do 200 sit ups a day. Well after adding that to my regular work out for two and a half years one morning I got done  working out and had to go right into ER and get operated on and  off work for 6 months. I was so depressed my abs were so much to me. they put me on every thing nothing worked. I was so depressed.  After it was all said and done the Doctor said all I could do was planks and running for my core I thought I would try Silenor after going over all the meds I had I can do regular things but that's it for abs.  YES!!!!!!!!!!!! Silenor works!!!!!! I get up in the morning and fill like a million bucks!!!!!!!!! hope this works for all .......................Lefty hag.",10,5,1
"Doxepin","NB","April 9, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started doxepin after being addicted to sleeping pills and pain killers and almost overdosing, I had insomnia, depression, anxiety, and chronic pain. It definitely saved my life when I needed it to but I gained 15 pounds, am easily irritated/angry, and  don't feel myself anymore. I couldn't get a refill for 2 weeks and I understand why you're not supposed to stop taking it suddenly because I couldn't get out of bed and wouldn't speak to anyone for 2 whole weeks, put me in a dark hole. But I think I'll stay on it so that kinda thing doesn't happen again.",7,6,1
"Doxepin","Grammie","October 14, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","Have been taking Doxepin for 25 years-am now just taking 10mg at night. Doxepin saved my life . It made me feel so good and able to live a normal life again. I am very afraid to stop taking it completely even though they say when you are older you should stop. Is that true?",0,16,1
"Doxepin","Fubar","August 6, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Well, my Dr had no skill, judgement but had experience causing injury to patients. He prescribed this out of the blue and foolishly I tried it, felt sick and wanted to stop taking it but my controlling fiance demanded I keep taking it! I know where the depression came from...I needed to get away from her, not taking old school meds. Some people might get relief from their symptoms with this since we are all different. This didn't work...quite a few side effects and the sleep didn't feel natural, at least for myself and didn't take it long enough to treat the depression. I can see how people sleep on this, you can fall asleep standing up the next day and for most of the day!",1,5,1
"Doxepin","staceya97","April 26, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed Doxepin for my PTSD-- I have social phobias, panic disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia and depressive disorder. First off, WEIGHT GAIN out the yazoo! I am very thin naturally, I'm 5'7 and 115lbs. I gained 15lbs and it very much so showed! I had to pick up working out 5 days a week to stay at the 130lbs and not put on more. Since my symptoms are severe I had to be at a higher dosage. I stopped at the 160mg. when I went to the E.R. from being impacted from the constipation this medication caused (and I was taking flaxseed, probiotics, Colace regularly being on it). Also, it didn't start kicking in for my panic disorder till about 125mg. and then it turned my panic to minimal and turned generalized anxiety on full-blown (which I never had before....). Helped for depression on lower dosages but didn't help for that at all after I went past 90mg on it. However, did absolute wonders for my depression at lower dosage. Lots of baggage overall, as most of these old time drugs have.",5,1,1

"Doxepin","Good morning70","June 5, 2017","-","I was prescribed doxepin by my Dr and was not given any informed consent regarding side effects or interactions. I am shocked that I had so many side effects almost instantly, very dangerous medication and I am sorry that I ever followed my Drs advice. I would be very careful with this med and any med that you put into your body. I wonder if the CEO of the company that invented this would let their children take it?!",1,18,1
"Doxepin","Anonymous","May 23, 2017","-","I was diagnosed with major depression at 42. I also suffered from crippling anxiety and chronic insomnia. I was prescribed Doxepin after trying other antidepressants  which had shocking side effects and made my symptoms worse. Doxepin pulled me out of the abyss and gave me my life back. It literally saved my life and I thank god every day for this amazing drug. I have been taking it for 23 years and it have had no side effects from prolonged use of this medication.",10,45,1
"Doxepin","Sarah Dooly","July 16, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My sister took doxipen and it had a horrible reaction... anxiety, changed her personality, sleeplesness... she told her Doctor so he increased the dose... she hadn't slept in 3 days so she took xanex to sleep... she died that night... 6/26/2016... she was 28 years old.",1,40,1

"Doxepin","Adriana77","April 9, 2016","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Has many years of  problems with depression, anxiety , derealization etc. Eventually learned these all related to Complex Multiple Trauma. But that is another story. Doxepin pretty much the ONLY antidepressant that has ever helped me. Totally a life saver over and over for me.  It is HIGHLY calming as well as anti-deprssing. That is because  simultaneous to increasing serotonin and norepinephrine,  is a beta adrenergic blocker (hence anti fear etc) BUT here is the real amazing thing about Doxepin - it is VERY anti- inflammatory. Neuroinflammation (brain inflammation) is a big issue  in mental health problems. Doxepin - out if ALL dregs, addresses this best of all. Search pub med. Doxepin has saved my life many times over several decades.",10,59,1
"Doxepin","Worth a shot","January 15, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was given silenor 3 mg at start to help me stay asleep and also to help with my anxiety and very mild depression... The doxepin in this medication is an anti depressant... My first try of it I felt drunk when I woke up at 3 am and I passed right back to sleep... I noticed within a week I felt a bit more happier and my anxiety has lessened... I feel more happier as well... So the doctor is keeping me on them for a while... It has been almost a year taking silenor... There was a slight weight gain over that period of time 10 lbs over the whole 10 months. I didn't take an entire week of the pills a few months back and boy did I notice.... They say non addictive but I felt sad and depressed... Right back where I was before taking them.",8,21,1
"Doxepin","Gonzo22","January 14, 2016","-","My Dr was unbelievably careless and combined this with another dangerous drug. I nearly died as the result and have contemplated dying well over 100,000 times since.  Any positive review of this drug should be highly skeptical of. This is a very dangerous drug that the manufacturers should stop making it, the sooner the better!",1,16,1
"Doxepin","fayfaith","September 20, 2015","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Sinequan (doxepin):</b>			 It works tremendously well on Insomnia and really does help on maintaining a normalcy in everyday life. Sleeping a lot at first, which in my case was a good thing. It's not the best for uplifting depression and doesn't help in taking away anxiety or panic attacks. The side affects for me was being easily bothered &amp; hostal/angry. Will pass if you continue taking as directed,but each time you stop n then start again the experience starts over. But keep in mind,side affects vary and its different for each  of Us. What works for one might not work for another. I've been taking Sinequan/Doxepin for over two decades.",0,56,1

"Doxepin","Anonymous","April 28, 2014","-","I have been taking doxepin at 25mg for about a month for depression, chronic pain and anxiety. All was somewhat fine, no side effects. To get the medicine working better, my doctor raised my dose to 50mg about 2wks ago. I am very happy so far.",9,57,1
"Doxepin","fayfaith","October 13, 2013","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been taking Doxepin &amp; Xanax and Zoloft for over 20 years, for depression/anxiety/panic attacks and insomnia. All three medicines work but only one has lasted, Doxepin. The other two I had no choice but to stop taking. I ended up with serious breathing problems. Zoloft several years after taking, subsided and then worse years later and Xanax after about a decade or so. Doxepin has done very well with all my conditions throughout the years with no serious problems. IT WORKS.",0,81,1
"Doxepin","Insomniac1985","February 27, 2013","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been diagnosed with chronic insomnia and general anxiety for 9 years. I also suffer from depression, but refuse to be medicated directly for it (specifically SSRI's) after dealing with Paxil and the horrible withdrawal I experienced 8 years ago. So recently I was prescribed 30mg Doxepin in addition to my Zolpidem (Ambien) for my insomnia. My insomnia has slightly improved, but more pronounced has been the reduction in both occurrence and severity of my anxiety (within the first week) and depression (after about 3-4 weeks). It's been about 6 weeks since I started the doxepin and haven't noticed any negative side effects besides some dry mouth/eyes, which is far outweighed by the benefits I've received.",9,82,1
"Doxepin","Anonymous","July 12, 2012","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started taking Doxepin for depression and insomnia. It seems to work good for both. I have not experienced any side effects so far.I  had been taking Zoloft for depression and felt like a robot, no feelings at all. I take 2, 10mg at night about an hour before I'm ready to go to sleep. If I don't go to sleep, I take 1 more. So far I'm happy with the medicine as it works for depression and insomnia.",9,65,1

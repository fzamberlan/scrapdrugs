No more spontaneous deep dark days ahead of me, my close family can really see a difference, I'm just worried about long term effects of this drug. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis.",8,5,1
"Zyprexa","Gigi","April 13, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medication Zyprexa is a miracle worker ! I was in a very deep depression,  suicide thoughts.

"Zyprexa","Emero","March 13, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was put on 17.5mg of zyprexa in 2017. I took this for 6 months before I finally decided to listen to my body and stop listening to the so called experts. Zyprexa made me dull, depressed and robotic. I now lack empathy, emotion, concentration and I no longer get pleasure from things I used to enjoy. Zyprexa zaps the joy from your life basically. There is no upside. Please please avoid this drug. It will steal your personality and nobody will believe you except for the people who have also been victims of this drug.",1,22,1
"Zyprexa","serj","December 18, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This drug is awful,  I should've stopped from day 1, now I'm in the 4th year and just started tapering because I'm one of the good boys that always listen to his parents and doctors. Please don't be a fool, don't take this drug it will make you lose years of your precious life.  Better be drug free as you know the only winner of your supposed condition is the big pharma that only wants your money every month.",1,23,1
"Zyprexa","Josh","October 29, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Hi all, I've been on Zyprexa for about a year and a half at 15mg. I was put on Zyprexa to help with severe treatment resistant depression. I also take 150mg of Effexor and 300mg of Welbutrin. In the past year my depression has slowly gotten worse and I suspect it's the Zyprexa. About 3 months ago I decided to taper myself off Zyprexa. I went from 15mg to 7.5mg for 3 months. I experience moderate sleeping issues (I sleep between 4-8 hours and wake up about 10 times during the night), nausea and a dramatic increase in depression. My highs are lower and my downs are longer and more severe.  My two questions are this: 1) Has anyone experienced increased depression as a result of taking Zyprexa  2) Has anyone experienced an increase in depression as a result of Zyprexa withdrawal.",6,23,1
"Zyprexa","Trapped1","August 15, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Zyprexa made me dull and gain weight, then found its impossible to stop taking. Even with a very, very slow taper, I have terrible withdrawal symptoms that I never ever experienced before olanzapine. I only took 1.25mg, and after 3 years of tapering  I'm down to about 0.7mg. Now I have heart arrhythmia, akathisia, insomnia, I feel dazed and out of it, erectile issues, and don't feel pleasure or get excited about anything. Olanzapine has ruined my life. If I could do one thing differently in my life it would be to never ever start taking this horrific drug.",1,46,1

"Zyprexa","maddie","April 19, 2019","-","put on this drug for anxiety, loss of weight, not sleeping, all connected with something that happened to me. On it for a month at 10 mg and had pounding blood pressure in ears, sudden headaches, ankles swelled up 2x their size, gained 25 lbs. in a month, huge appetite, foggy thinking, flat personality and dizzy. After I got off, I felt much better. Off  it now for 2.5 months and I can't lose any weight, and in fact am still gaining, so can't get it out of my system. How can i get it out of my system? I don't want to become diabetic or get heart disease, but this drug can do that and I'M NOT EVEN ON IT! Doctors are putting people on it that should NOT be given this drug, it should be a last resort if at all. This drug can cause permanent changes chemically, in metabolism and dopamine receptors in brain-is there no antidote?",2,37,1
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","March 27, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Zyprexa made me feel very tired and irritable.

"Zyprexa","Me","October 31, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","A doctor said I had bipolar and put me on Zyprexa and Lexapro. It was a nightmare, I told my doctor it made my depression worse and that I developed restless leg syndrome while on it. The doctor completely ignored me. After months of this horrible nightmare, I switched doctor's and was told I am NOT bipolar, but suffer from depression. I was tapered off Zyprexa and now I feel 100% better. Thankful",1,34,1
"Zyprexa","Lilone","September 30, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have ever been a fan of antidepressants as I feel they are a bandaid for underlying problems. I starting to think differently.

"Zyprexa","Ed McLendon","September 15, 2017","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Zyprexa withdrawal is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my 55 year old life. I took 2.5 mg for 6 years. Sure it helped me sleep for a few months and that is why I did not know what was causing the terrible grief and over all health problems I was experiencing. I was fainting without warning because of this drug. It ruined my life and I have not touched zyprexa in almost 2 years! It is a drug so terrible it should not be prescribed to anybody. The makers of this drug should be totally ashamed of themselves. They really should be punished for what they have done and continue doing to peoples lives with this drug. No joke.",1,47,1

"Zyprexa","Maxiemar","December 23, 2016","-","Definitely relieved morning anxiety attacks. I'm also taking Effexor and Klonopin. I take the Zyprexa at night because it does make me sleepy. I wasn't eating anything at all before starting this drug, so I'm not worried yet about the weight gain; I'm not overdoing it with the food. I don't plan to be on this for long; my doctor told me it's not really a maintenance medication. But if it gets me through the Holidays and my horrible anxiety about work, I'm fine with that.",7,35,1

For years have taken 60 mg Celexa, .5 mg Clonazepam, and ( .5 mg Xanax if I need for emergency panic attack) They worked well until 6 years ago, my husband died, a year later my dad died.Two years after my dad passed his wife died, then 4mo. later my son, who had Downs Syndrome died on the operating table. I was really going into a deep black hole by then but it just got worse. A friend of 25 yrs died of cancer not even a year after my son. I can really feel a difference in just 3 days. No crying so far, been outside and to the store without panic attacks. Sleep really well. So far eating hasn't been a problem, have lots of energy, and just feel better.

"Zyprexa","rb1979","April 9, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was on Zyprexa from Mar 2015 till Aug 2015. At first it seemed like it was mellowing me out a bit, and I could sleep through the whole night, which was an improvement. After a few months I noticed my depression was getting much worse. Came off the drug cold turkey, and went through one of the most serious withdrawals one could face. Depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, night terrors took over. To this day Apr 2016, I have still not returned to the way I was before I started taking this horrible drug. Depression and anxiety are still bad, not as bad as 6 mos ago, but still worse than when I first started taking it. I'm convinced this drug can cause permanent brain damage.",2,57,2
"Zyprexa","beedoose","November 4, 2015","-","Sure this med can keep depression at bay but it can also cause some really horrible side effects. After being on this med for 1 yr I went from being a healthy 170 lbs (women's size 12) to 250 lbs (size 20). It made me so lethargic and tired. I would sleep for 14 hours a day and still be dragging out of bed. About 2 months ago was the final straw. I got blood work done by my GP and my triglycerides were through the roof as well as elevated blood sugar. The doc was ready to put me on meds for diabetes! I'm only 25 and I just wanted my health back so last week I went to a new doc who got me off this horrible stuff. I feel like a new person without this toxic med in my body. Now on Viibryd.",2,48,2

I have put on an insane amount of weight, admittedly needed, due to suffering anorexia, but when I started on this medication I weighed 37kg and 6 months later nearly doubled to 65 kg. This I feel is an unnatural weight gain in such a short time, and now I don't go out due to feeling bad about how I look.",1,35,2

I cannot say my hunger and weight gain was completely due to Zyprexa but I do know that I now take only 5mg a day, at night, sleep well, hunger is normal and I have lost weight with good healthy choices and exercise. I no longer have depression and life has never been better. Zyprexa, therapy, exercise, support and nutrition has saved my life.",7,100,2

You just cannot take this and eat chips, candy, etc. Lean meats, proteins and veg and you will have NO problems, the effect is worth it. If you can put the fork down, it can change your life. My Dr. warned me about the potential for weight gain, but told me he thought I had the willpower to resist the cravings to eat junk, which I did. Try it.",10,234,2

While the Zyprexa helped remove intrusive thinking, it added about thirty pounds onto my slender frame, made me severely tired, and took away my sex drive.  In addition to these adverse effects, I was unmotivated/uninterested in many activities that used to give me pleasure. I had a so what attitude about life in general.  All because of this medicine.

My doctor did not want me on Benzo's anymore (says it increased alcohol cravings).  I stayed on Lexapro only for 9 months, but my anxiety came back strong on just the Lexapro alone.  I almost resorted to taking Xanax before I switched doctors. My new doc gave Zyprexa a chance. I am on my 7th day and I haven't felt this normal in 5 years.

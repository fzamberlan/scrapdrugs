"Lamotrigine","PoppyA12","March 4, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I've just started to take lamotrigine today and it's making me feel calm but also feel sick. I'm going to continue with it to see how it is. Plus I'm on venlafaxine 225mg roll on more tiredness",5,3,1
"Lamotrigine","tried_it","February 11, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Everyone will have a different reaction to this, or any medicine, but for me, lamotrigine really worsened my depression. I felt emotionally unstable, and it was giving me bipolar symptoms of feeling like I had excess energy, which I never had before. I feel much better now after discontinuing it.",1,12,1
"Lamotrigine","Jay","February 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","the first day on  lamitrogine has been an absolute life changer! I was having severe hopeless depression paired with anxiety. My moods seemed to shift from one to another triggered by hormones or stress. It developed into eating disorder over time untreated. I've tried every SSRI and off label blood pressure meds etc. I always have them a good run and they always had a lot of side effects and made my original symptoms worse. Then after research I asked my psychiatrist for lamictal. I had 0 side effects!! I started at a dose of 25mg for 2 weeks and am at the end of 2 weeks on 50mg. I felt the difference by the second week of 25mg and even more at 50mg. I have felt so hopeful and excited at times in perfectly healthy ways and depression and anxiety is all but gone. I don't feel doped up at all just a better version of me than I have ever felt. Also unlike SSRIs this doesn't impact sex drive and if I get pregnant it's safe. Love and plan to stay on it for a long time. It's worth it!",10,36,1
"Lamotrigine","Angie","December 20, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Lamictal has been a live-saver for me. I began taking it as an inpatient at 16 years old for very severe depression, and now after two and a half years I feel like my mood has completely leveled out. I don't experience extreme highs and lows anymore, I just feel normal. That doesn't mean I never get sad or never feel happy, just not to the extremes that I used to, which I'm totally fine with. The only problems I've had were that it took a really long time for it to start working for me; I still found myself experiencing depressive episodes six months after beginning taking it. However, they weren't as bad as they were before, and after another several months the depressive episodes were pretty much nonexistent. Also, it didn't help much for anxiety like I was told it would, but it didn't increase anxiety for me either.",9,23,1
"Lamotrigine","Angry mom","December 2, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Research side effects of this lamotrigine drug! Especially Stevens Johnsons Syndrome. This is NOT just a rash as your doctor would say, should be labeled as a burn. Signs of the syndrome are swelling of eyes and lips. Then your whole body starts blistering. Skin peeling. My child has been in hospital for 2 weeks now because of this drug and Stevens-Johnsons syndrome . Never recommend this medication to anyone.",1,15,1
"Lamotrigine","MT Gal","November 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’ve been on Lamotrigine since mid-August. I titrated up slowly and am at maintenance dose of 200mg daily. I was on every depression/anxiety medication you can think of for the past 20 years. I had to wean off those as lamotrigine was introduced. So far it has made a remarkable difference in my moods, my depression, my motivation. I love not laying in bed all day. Going on it was not easy however. My anxiety was high, migraines, fatigue, insomnia. These have resolved but it’s taken 3 months. I’m thrilled at the difference it made in me and pray it continues to work! Remember it took months and 200 mg dose until I felt better.",9,43,1
"Lamotrigine","KMH","November 13, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I have major depression and the moment I took Lamotrigine I felt a lot better.  I take two 200mg pill a day and have seen an improvement so much so I can actually put a smile on my face.",10,32,1
"Lamotrigine","T","November 7, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was put on Lamitrigine after Citalopram stopped working, and Escitalopram made me suicidal. I expressed that I'd wanted to avoid certain symptoms of SSRI's again and med nurse prescribed this. I've been on it for about two months -- titrating up from 25mg/2weeks, 50mg/2 weeks, and 100mg now. I haven't noticed any improvement in my depression, nor anxiety, or other symptoms therein in addition to the ones caused by and exacerbated by my ADHD. If anything I think I might be a little more unhinged (overly sensitive, mood drops happening with more frequency, lots more bouts of crying) but that could easily be because of something else. So, I haven't noticed any bad side effects (lymph nodes got a little swollen? which was something I was told to look out for, but it's Sick Season) but it hasn't helped in the slightest, either. I don't have any energy or motivation, which is kind of needed to make any progress in therapy, so.. definitely switching meds the first chance I get.",3,11,1
"Lamotrigine","E","October 30, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I'm diagnosed ADHD, anxiety, depression and PTSD and have been in a very dark place for months and very depressed and anxious and suicidal thoughts. I'm on several medications for months, Venlafaxine, Wellbutrin and Vyvanse which are little to no help. Lamictal was added and I'm now on 100 mg daily in the morning and my depression is entirely gone and so is my anxiety. I don't get mood swings anymore, I am calmer and less pessimistic. I've had no side effects except some minor itching upon dose increases lasting for a day or so. I don't feel emotionally numb. I just feel like a calmer, more logical, happier version of myself. I've tried so many medications over the years for my depression and anxiety (over 20) and this is the first one to truly help. A miracle medication for me. It can take time to find the right medications for you but don't give up hope.",10,53,1
"Lamotrigine","DifficultDays","October 15, 2019","-","Took about 6-8 weeks on lamotrigine, but the depression went away. Side effects seem to be much worse nervousness/fear/anxiety, extreme weight loss and starvation (metabolism revved up). Dramatic increase in migraines which may be due to hunger and stress.",5,19,1

I was put on 200mg of Lamictal, along with other meds. I feel completely flat and I think it’s the Lamictal. I have no emotions and my motivation is extremely low. I KNOW I love my daughter but I don’t FEEL that love. This is an example of having no emotions. And I hate it. I WANT to feel that love. I want to feel ANYTHING. I’m just flat.",2,34,1
"Lamotrigine","Rb","October 13, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","SSRIs stopped working and gave me fibromyalgia. My stomach lining was burning, but that might have been the Remeron or the combination. Lamotrigine reduced my depression 50-100%. Not sure why some days are better than others. My fear/anxiety is much much worse. I can barely eat. My memory is terrible so I can't remember my memory prior to lamotrigine! I suspect these symptoms are caused by it but I can't be sure.  I've lost my appetite twice prior to taking it, but never this bad. Night terrors but I can't remember if I had them prior.",5,10,1

I highly recommend it.",10,26,1
"Lamotrigine","DeeB","August 24, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Lamictal has changed my life!!! I have had medication resistant depression for over 30 years. I am now 60. Have been on every med out there only to keep from being suicidal at best. Was on abilify for 3 or 4 years with Viibryd. Gained 30 lbs and cholesterol went sky high. So as a last resort decided to try lamictal. I am on 150mg and 30mg of Viibryd. It has totally changed my life. I am no longer depressed at ALL!   My friends and family are amazed at the difference they see in me. I am socializing with people and taking care of myself again. I think I feel better than I did before being diagnosed with depression. Now I know we all react to meds differently but if you are having trouble finding something that works this is worth a try. I have major depression,  not bipolar. I say that because most things I read about using lamictal was to help with bipolar. But it can also help as an add on to your antidepressant. I thank GOD I found out about it.",10,74,1

Buuuutttttt the insurance wants to charge me over $400 for lamictal, 2 dollars for generic.  Has anybody else experienced the difference between the 2. I've been on it for years. So depressed right now. The insurance company ants me to try 3 other drugs before they will give me lamictal! Everybody on here knows what that would be like. So frustrated",0,16,1

"Lamotrigine","CTAMM","July 24, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Having suffered from treatment resistant chronic depression and GAD for years I had been on so many medications - either efficacy was short lived or side effects unacceptable (weight gain, lethargy, hyperness, insomnia, agitation, +++) In 2013 my MD prescribed 100 mg Lamotrigine with 20mg Trintellex once a day. I can’t begin to describe the amazing efficacy these 2 medications have had on my depression and anxiety. Everyone has their ups and downs, that’s life - but chronic depression is nothing but days of downs - so hard to live with - for the first time in 30 years I feel ‘normal’. Trintellex has an added benefit of reducing brain fog, and my thinking is clearer. Lamotrigine enhances the the overall control of major depressive disorder, and I am so grateful for the relief these 2 medications provide. One down side: Trintellex is still under patent, but Takeda offers cost reduction support because it is terribly expensive.",10,28,1
"Lamotrigine","Ari","July 12, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Lamotrigine is my miracle drug. I’ve dealt with severe depression since 15, had a bit of remission but when it came back full force in my early 20’s nothing would help. HIGH dose Zoloft, Effexor, Seroquel, lexapro... I react quickly to drugs.  I had hit a new low, then started effexor and I knew in  two weeks, but it was almost immediate for me I started to feel better. Suicidal thoughts slowly started to fade, less spending all day in despair, less sleeping, less crying. I still have to augment with Wellbutrin and Xanax and Prazosin, but Lamotrigine was what flipped the first switch.",10,22,1
"Lamotrigine","Kitty5109","June 18, 2019","-","I started lamictal about 2 months ago off label to treat severe treatment resistant depression. I was titrated up  too quickly and broke out in  the rash  on day 8. I was pretty bummed because I had noticed a drastic improvement in my mood.  My doctor and I decided to stop the drug and wait a month after the rash was gone at a slow titration.  The depression became unbearable and I began experiencing suicidal thoughts.  I began lamictal again 5 days ago.  My depression significantly lifted. I gave it a 9 because it did make my acne worse (who wants a face full of pimples at age 33?!) But I’ll treat the breakouts. I’d rather have acne than feel the way I did.  I am praying the rash doesn’t return because this is saving my life. I suffer from anxiety too. This drug has helped with my social/generalized anxiety. I am nervous about the stories I have read about hair loss. I hope that doesn’t happen to me.  In 9 more days I will go up to 50mg per day. This is a miracle drug!",9,33,1

"Lamotrigine","Jason","May 21, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I started lamictal during a life upheaval leading to acute, severe depression and after a bad reaction to lexapro (worsening depression and suicidal). Starting at Lamotrigine 25mg within 1 to 2 days I felt immediate relief. I worked up to 75mg and stuck with that for several months. Circumstance lead to worsening depression and went to 150mg once daily and now at 200mg and holding steady. I have stopped years of benzo, Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax. Now only take Lamictal. This medication provides a wall against depressive thoughts, behaviors. Also mood swings and rage issues that I suffered most of my life are almost completely absent. This med has given me a chance to live happily even during times of great change and struggle. Time to time I consider going off, but I'm afraid of relapse. Have been taking 3 years.",10,60,2

However, for me, lamotrigine has built a foundation which reduces my severe depression (suicidal most of 2018, due to bipolar &amp; anxiety getting much worse, totally disabling), with no side effects except maybe it is a little harder to fall asleep (but I have intrusive images &amp; flashbacks when trying to fall asleep anyway). I am still depressed, but not frighteningly so now. I have taken so many meds with so many terrible side effects, so having virtually none on this is a rare miracle. It does little for PTSD or anxiety or OCDs for me - well it helps after I've just taken it (and gives me back energy depression destroyed), but this only lasts 2-3 hours.

I believe everyone should get to a therapeutic level and wait at least two months before they give up unless you get the rash or really depressed or anything else that can be life threatening. All These medicines takes time to work. You won’t feel it working in a week or sooner that’s just the placebo effect if you feel it working.

I am currently at 300mg a day  with the plan being to go right up to 400mg/day.  The first thing I found was coming off another antidepressant can be quite rough, but Lamictal seemed to have eased that transition so I felt quite positive about it. As the dose increased, I was always questioning if it was helping or if it was placebo effect. I am still on the fence with this one but I will update in a few weeks as I get closer to the 400mg mark. I am cautiously optimistic still.

Lamotrigine made it easier for me to lower the thoughts of worthlessness and emptiness. This drug allows me to see a bright future for once. It helps control my anger and sadness.

I don't fit the criteria for bipolar because I don't get manic and my depression showed up more as anxiety. Any how, I started taxing lamotrigine XR and it has changed my life! I get nervous I am going to jinx it by admitting out loud how much it has helped me:) I used to read these posts and pray I had the same positive experiences. I am glad to say lamotrigine XR has given me that experience! The firing in my brain is finally calm!!!!",10,110,4

Eventually I started experiencing blurry vision and I read that was a common side effect, so I weaned off of it.",4,21,4
"Lamotrigine","Stacie331","January 18, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I am currently on a 150mg maintenance dosage. I do take this in combination with other medications because I also have Panic/Anxiety Disorder with Agoraphobia. A year ago I was in such a deep depression (for months). I was not exactly suicidal but often prayed I would go to sleep &amp; not wake up. I began seeing a new psychiatrist &amp; he immediately started me on Lamictal. Literally within weeks I noticed my depression was now under control! I truly believe this medication saved my life. I am definitely still a work in progress, but I am in a much better place. I can actually see the future.",10,112,4
"Lamotrigine","Colin charles","December 19, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on various anti depressants since my late teens. Everything's from fluoxetine citalopram, clomipramine and in a full breakdown; a combination of mirtazapine and Effexor. It was this last one which took me sky high and so I stopped, also due to 30kg weight gain. After a couple of months I was suicidal and because I was diagnosed with bipolar since the mania on the antidepressants I was recommended going on to a cocktail of quetiapine, depakote and lithium. No way was I taking that with the side effects and the horror stories about weight gain as I've lost the 30kg in weight I put on. Lamotrigine I heard was the only one for helping without the weight gain so I gave it a go. It took about 2 months but it works a treat now on 300mg",8,53,4
"Lamotrigine","ChristyCee1987","December 11, 2015","-","I am diagnosed with major depression. My doctor added Lamictal because Wellbutrin alone was not effective. The addition of Lamictal improved my symptoms and maintained this improvement.  There are three side effects I get with it.  I get mild nausea, mild euphoria and sleepiness.  I highly recommend it. My doctor says he has great results using it with his patients.",9,69,4
"Lamotrigine","Juniper Berry","November 25, 2015","-","I originally began Lamotrigine about 6 weeks ago for Visual Snow syndrome caused by hallucinogen use. I am only on 75mg at this point as I've had to titrate up slowly. I've suffered major depression for most of my life and mild anxiety in the past year. I have noticed a HUGE difference in my mood on Lamotrigine. I have a greater sense of well being, I no longer think about suicide and I feel great about myself. It also decreases the intensity of my visual snow symptoms. I hardly notice or care about it anymore. No side effects either. This drug has truly been a blessing.",10,72,4

"Lamotrigine","Rick23","September 20, 2015","-","I have had depression episodes all my life and had never been medicated. Three years ago, I had a huge burnout and finally opted for meds. I have tried Celexa, Effexor, Abilify &amp; Cipralex. All of them helped to some extent but not to completely stop the depression in the long term. My psychiatrist recommended Lamotrigine. I had seen on this site so many positive reviews that I decided to try it. Like many others, it has been a miracle drug for me. I have been on it for 3 months now and aside for 2 or 3 small bumps on the road, I feel great! Except for dry mouth (not that bad), I have had no side effects. Don't give up! Good luck :-)",10,125,5
"Lamotrigine","Kritkat228","September 7, 2015","-","I have bipolar 2 and anxiety. I've been on and off different medications for this over  the last 20 years. I started on a small dosage about 7 months ago. I slowly made my way up to 100 mg oncedaily. I did have some skin reactions with each increase but it would disappear after a few days. This with my 150mg bupropion and 60mg of duloxtine has changed my life. I've only felt suicidal once over these 7 months and it was manageable and it abated quickly. My moods are stable and I've been able to face some challenges that would have crushed me if I wasn't taking lamotrigine. I love being stable and level headed. I do have some minor thought blocking and trouble remembering words sometimes but I'll take it!",10,72,5

It really works great and I have been on everything.

I was surprised because Lamictal is usually given to bipolar people and I'm absolutely not bipolar, but it has really helped me.  The only side effect I noticed is a tendency to break out a little more (not THE RASH).  No weight gain (weight gain is an issue with so many other depression meds) and no other problems.",10,88,5

"Lamotrigine","notfine","October 1, 2014","-","I've been taking Lamotrigine for a few years.  When I first started it, I was amazed.  They gave it to me as a mood stabilizer.  It helped tremendously.  And still does.  I've been afraid they'd try to change it. That was one of my first medicines for severe depression.  It doesn't make you a zombie at all.  I do struggle with the making you tired or sleepy side effect.  But everything makes me tired and sleepy.  I have a couple other meds and they all make you sleepy.  I had no other side effects.  I would highly recommend trying this medication if it's offered or suggested. Give it a couple months if you're not sure if it's working.  Especially if you're trying it along with other newer medications.",9,128,5

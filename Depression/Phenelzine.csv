"Phenelzine","Jamesy","June 5, 2020","-","I live in the UK. I was put on Nardil in 1980s when I was 25.  I was suffering bad phobias and anxiety attacks. Adrenalin was running riot and lost weight, had a red face and nose and was close to not leaving my house. They saved my life and I have been on them nearly 35 years. I have tried a couple of  times to come off them but felt awful. I am fortunate my doctors get me unlicensed import supplies but they do cost a fortune, the pharmacy showed me the prices. I have to wait a long time for each prescription as Clinigen charge around £40 per 60 tabs for the unbranded phenelzine but are out of stock and the Nardil branded ones are around £220 per 60 tabs!  The UK supplier to NHS charged around £20 per 100 tablets. All about money and my pharmacist asked if I could try and come off them, the biggest fear is that they are stopped being produced. If so, I don't think I will have a life to live, it's so scary.",10,2,1

I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed Desyrel, which did nothing.  I went to another psychiatrist. This one prescribed imiprimine. No good. Then we tried desiprimine among others. Nothing. Meanwhile I went to the library and did research on atypical depressions. There was no internet then. I asked for a script for Nardil. He was wary of prescribing it and prescribed something else. Again no good. The next time I almost begged to try it, and he agreed. About four or five days later the clouds lifted and the sun came out. I have never experienced a miracle, but Nardil comes close. The obsessive thoughts stopped. So did the guilt, the feelings of self-worthlessness, the suicidal ideation, and the anhedonia. All gone.

I felt great after about a week and my energy levels are so high, that I have to set an alarm to actually sleep!

Shortly after I stopped drinking,  I  had my first panic attack. I saw a psychiatrist who prescribed an antipsychotic drug. I tried most of the tricyclic drugs over the next couple of years. These either didn't work or side effects were intolerable. My physician referred me to a psychiatrist who immediately prescribed Nardil. Thirty three years later,  I 'm stable  being on Nardil. I haven't had problems with food interactions as I've checked my BP over the years when trying different foods. The only drawback of Nardil is having to have pharmacies order it every time I need it.  The worst situation was when the manufacturer got behind on a supply of Nardil. I phoned over 20 different drug stores only to find out they had no Nardil either. Cold turkey with no advance warning of the shortage.

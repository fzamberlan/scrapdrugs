"Lithium","WildcatVet","June 6, 2020","-","This old-fashioned medication lithium was a lifesaver for me (I have depression) and I've taken it for years and years with absolutely no side effects or adverse events.  To my mind there's nothing like it (in fact, it's the ONLY true mood stabilizer) and I've been on too many medications and combinations to count. This is the only drug that's given me relief from suicidal depression.",10,3,1
"Lithium","Mood Stabalizer","January 26, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Used Lithium liquid form for 1 month and then 700 mg capsule daily for 8 months. Experienced: brain on fire, confusion, unable to: speak, think, and slow mental physical reaction. Woke up shaking. Urinated very frequently. Drank lots of water to reduce the side effects and symptoms. Smoked a lot more cigarettes. Felt like so sick. Drooled and moved very slow. Felt like a zombie. Had muscle weakness. Paranoid thinking. Made me very confessional. Been off this chemical for 3 months and can now write, think, and move faster again. I had reconnected with GOD. The only positive was finding GOD and praying for life again. I was just a spirit in a body that would barely function.",1,16,1
"Lithium","boywonder","November 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Over the years I've been on many antidepressants. Sadly none worked until I started Lithium. I have far fewer terrible days and less suicidal thoughts. It's not perfect. I get a dry mouth and for the first day or two I constantly needed to pee. That's all stopped now and for me it's truly a life saver.",8,15,1
"Lithium","ali","November 2, 2019","-","Like most of you I had tried all of regular anti depressants until I found the lithium. As an major depression patient the most dismal and horrible thing about depression is brain fog that the lithium doesn't eliminate it completely. Some drs say it's has to be a combination, so lithium with an anti depressant. After taking 2 years lithium solely I still have brain fog.",8,9,1
"Lithium","Aileen","September 4, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I just started Lithium at 600mg for depression. I’ve tried SO many antidepressants over this seven year depressive episode. I’ve felt emotionally flat, have trouble concentrating and remembering things, and live in a brain fog. It’s been especially devastating since I was forced to leave a wonderful career due to this illness.  My psychiatrist finally referred me to a world-renowned doctor. This doctor responded to me within two days.  He said that Lithium along with Spravado and intensive TMS is the appropriate treatment. (The TMS is done for 9 minutes, 10(!) times a day for 5 days.  This protocol is approved and has conducted studies on it.)  He also  said that side effects such as weight gain and tremors are minimal and occur if the dosage is above the therapeutic level.  I’m, of course, going to take regular blood tests. I am so thankful that I’m receiving  excellent care. Will report on progress.",0,17,1
"Lithium","HumongousChungus","July 18, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Taking this med tells me a bit more about my mental illness. Being diagnosed as Bipolar 2, which I absolutely don’t believe anymore After Li, my doctor prescribed me this after a long trial with lamictal didn’t work. I was on lamictal for 11 months and it never really helped with depression. I have been on 300mg ER lithium for 3 weeks, and then 450 for 5 days. Made me hypersomniac, horrible brain fog, more sensitive to thoughts, DEPRESSED, no motivation and always tired! Anxiety &amp; occasional panic attacks still linger. I am already tapering down to 225mg. I don’t think this will work out. It makes me feel flat &amp; just as or more depressed than being unmedicated. Mood stabilizers don’t work for me. At this point I’d rather try an antipsychotic over Depabloat.",3,11,1
"Lithium","Hambone","July 5, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Lithium takes the edge off my moods without intolerable side effects. It will not make me happy, any more than the other prescriptions I have tried, but I doubt that's what any of them are really intended   for.  I have fewer suicidal thoughts, or at least the emotions accompanying them are less acute, more measured and rational.  (Yes, it's perfectly possible to be both rational and have suicidal thoughts.) The main side effects have been fatigue and odd dreams. If I increase the dose I expect, based on past Rx experiences, to feel  less stressed but  more drugged.  That is a tradeoff I will have to consider.  I can't predict what I will decide. Given the extremely low cost of lithium and its widely acknowledged benefits in even small doses, I may just stick to the latter and accept the modest results that accrue.",5,14,1
"Lithium","Holly","June 14, 2019","-","I've been on 400mg lithium carbonate for nearly a year, before that I was getting episodes of suicidal depression every 3 or 4 months despite being on anti-depressants. Since I went on lithium I haven't had anything but slight low mood. I get a hand tremor at times, mild muscle pain and heartburn, but it's a lot preferable to being in that dark pit of despair.",9,22,1
"Lithium","Panda","January 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Serious cognitive problems surfacing after three weeks, trouble recalling a word, name or phrase. This has never happened to me....talking to my dr today. It’s like fast onset Alzheimer’s. Terrifying. Only other side effect is nausea which means I can’t eat during the day.",6,11,1
"Lithium","Charles120","June 18, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Went to see my psychiatrist and I was a little down because of stuff that's been going on in my life. He said I was going through a depression and prescribed me lithium. I started at 300mg daily with the aim of reaching 900mg after three weeks. The experience has not been a good one so far. My brain is in a constant chemical fog and I lost my mind's sharpness. Everything is more difficult : walking, thinking, talking... I slowed to a crawl and lost my natural love for Life. I took it upon myself to reduce the dosage and withdrawal has been painful. Serious mood swings and thinking impairment. I can't wait for the drug to be out of my system for good. P.S. I take it alongside Risperdal and Celexa, so perhaps the side effects were due to a combination. Your mileage may vary.",3,12,1
"Lithium","fibrodoll","June 8, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I have treatment resistant severe major depressive disorder, PTSD and OCD. I was on lithium for less than a month when I developed lithium toxicity, it is unknown how this happened. I was in the hospital for 3 days to flush my system out. Next to cymbalta, lithium is the worst experience I've had with a psych med. I have been on over 20 different meds for my mental health and they do not work for me. Next up electro-convulsive therapy.",0,18,1
"Lithium","Koalamaiden","October 20, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Have been on lithium for years. Have to be careful of the heat, hot baths or working up a sweat, as the heat effects lithium in your body. I’m on lithium SR it’s kinder than lithicarb. I had no side effects on the extended release. On the lithium I drank litres of water, felt sick to my stomach for days but extended release there was almost no side effects. Its lithium but sustained release, not so hard.",9,12,1
"Lithium","chrl","August 19, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on venlafaxine and seroquel for about a year, and since it wasn't making much difference to my emotional state nor reducing suicidal ideation, my doctor removed the seroquel and replaced it with lithium. The first two weeks of being on it were possibly the worst two weeks of my life. In that time I slept no more than two hours a night, some nights not sleeping at all. I was incredibly suicidal and my skin all over my body itched. After that two weeks it seemed to flip like a switch and suddenly all I could do was sleep. I'm still on it a few months later and while the negative side effects have calmed down, I don't feel it has improved my mood at all. If anything it's made it flatter.",2,17,1
"Lithium","NCmomof2","July 25, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I have major depression and borderline personality traits (Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) has helped), and chronic suicidal thoughts for over 30 years. I am on Mirtazapine 30mg, Bupropion XL 300mg for over two years. Because of my suicidal thoughts my Dr put me on lithium three weeks ago. She started with 300mg then went up to 600mg. They only bad side affect for me was a very dry mouth. After 2 weeks of being on it it started feeling wonderful! And it helped my suicidal thoughts tremendously. I felt so much better and have more energy ! Then she decided to bump me up to 900mg per day. The only side effect I feel is, I feel like there is pressure on my brain. I'm hoping this is going to go away like my dry mouth. I also am not sleeping well either.",9,28,1
"Lithium","No Lithium","May 24, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","At first I felt better but the then terrible weakness and tremors. Decided to get off but having unbearable anxiety. I was only on 600mg for two weeks and have dropped it to 300mg and soon to 150mg.",0,12,1
"Lithium","Owl Capone","April 7, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been on 75mg venlafaxine and 60mg mirtazapine for quite some time, with generally good results. Though my depressive symptoms were largely improved, I remained suicidal and lacking motivation in life. I recently added 300mg of lithium carbonate, and have noticed some improvement with the suicidality. My main complaint is that I am less socially engaging, as if there is nothing to talk about, I could just be quiet most of the day. My mood is relatively flat, I'm not sure if I will take it for long but it is worth a try.",6,12,1
"Lithium","Canada345","February 19, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Effective at treating depression, however hit my kidneys and thyroid pretty hard, as soon as I went up to adequate blood levels. Mind you, I am otherwise a healthy young male, so be careful with this med. Was on it for a few months, after stopping, kidney and thyroid went back to normal. Now I just take 300mg a day, and my lithium levels are not where they should be but I think it still helps a bit at a low dose, without the serious side effects. I also take lithium orotate, which supposedly passes blood brain barrier and requires just a fraction of lithium in the blood, eliminating the usual side effect. That is still up for debate thou and I encourage you to do your own research but user reviews for lithium orotate seem to be excellent.",7,24,1
"Lithium","Jen3256","October 27, 2016","-","I have attempted suicide three times in my life. The first two times were before I knew of Lithium and the third was when I took a break from Lithium, foolishly thinking I had gotten better. Lithium, at 900mg, almost completely eliminates the suicidal ideation. Symptoms of depression still present, however much better. Side effects I have had are weight gain (5 lbs?), frequent urination/thirst, thinning of my hair and sometimes I feel tired. I'll take these side effects any day over how I used to feel. This medicine has kept me alive.  If you have recurring suicidal ideation, I would highly recommend.",10,53,1
"Lithium","Eff-B","October 27, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I have life-long treatment resistant depression and I'm taking a SNRI, recently started Lithium Carbonate as augmentation. It just makes me very tired at the starting dose. Although I'll try, I don't expect increasing the dose will help and feeling so tired is very counterproductive for me. Also, have the typical thirst and no appetite. If it causes weight gain, that will make it even worse.",1,13,1
"Lithium","Divine in Time","September 27, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I have to say Lithium has change my life for the good. I started taking this med, just 5 days ago and it's like I got my life back. I have paranoid schizophrenia and major depression and borderline personality disorder. The past 8 years were literally like hell on earth for me. I've tried so many different medication and nothing really worked for me. The first time I took my Lithium I felt like more in tuned on what's going on. Now I'm on day 5 and my racing thoughts are pretty much gone. My depression is vanishing. My voice's are at a minimum. My anixiety from going out in public has been getting better and better. It actually boost's my confidence. My energy level has gone way up. I'm generally more happier and more at peace.",10,61,1
"Lithium","Jillian3675","August 26, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have tried so many antidepressants over the last two years and actually found them to only increase the severity of my depression. I found one that helped finally but still felt symptoms of depression creeping in.  I asked my Dr to augment with lithium and it worked! My fatigue is nonexistent now and I feel like I can handle life now.  At first I was so thirsty that I could drink the entire Atlantic Ocean with a straw. It has since improved--but I learned that no matter how much I drink, I'm still going to have some thirst so I don't over do it. My mouth is dry and I have a very slight tremor in my hands but it's a small price to pay----now I get to live instead of just survive. :)  Ps aincrease your dose slowly to minimize side effects",9,49,1
"Lithium","Kyle BC","July 25, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was on it for over a month. Made me extremely sad, much more than usual and caused some constant, very scary suicidal ideation. When I went off it I felt better, (as better as I can be), immediately.",1,21,1
"Lithium","Lucy33","July 8, 2016","-","I took this drug in combination with Zoloft and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and ever since then my ability to write and create has just not been the same. I have been off of these drugs for a few months and these things have not returned to normal, which is quite distressing. Unfortunately it's impossible to tell if this problem resulted from the lithium, the Zoloft, the TMS or some combination of all three. Regardless of its effect on my capacity for written expression, I did not experience any relief from this medication. For instance, lithium is supposed to reduce suicidal thoughts, but I did not notice any decrease in these feelings or inclinations at all; nor did it help with sadness, motivation, etc.",1,22,1
"Lithium","TOPALE","June 7, 2016","-","it helped somewhat for my antidepressant to work",3,10,1
"Lithium","Samiam27","January 7, 2016","-","Tried a lot of SSRIs before a doctor prescribed a medium dose of lithium. Can't even describe how much better I feel. I used to feel so stuck by my depression and am now able to do so much more with my life. My sex drive dropped off a little but I'm not otherwise feeling flat from it. Didn't have any of the weight gain or shaking side effects. Changed my life.",9,71,1
"Lithium","Steve Stevenson","November 14, 2015","-","This medication, in combination with a med for sleep, alleviated me of suicidal ideation in matter of one week inpatient. On the downside, I do feel quite flat, and the effects on my health are not able to be known this early on. The poor health feelings are usually due to the drug not being eliminated fast enough by your liver. I received minimal therapy and didn't experience life improvement, yet all bouts of suicidal depression are gone. Depression for me is now less severe, and more transient.",8,30,2
"Lithium","Kristys1989","January 10, 2015","-","Even though it's not used for the treatment of OCD, it took mine away completely as well as significantly cleared up my depression. About a year after being on it I became extremely thirsty, drinking two liters a day and urinating frequently. I have had to since come off it and symtoms have returned.",10,30,2
"Lithium","Proponent of Lithium For Suicidal Ideation","October 21, 2013","-","Lithium is my Wonder Drug. I'm 51, was depressed on &amp; off for years, had major depression for 7+ years, &amp; have been suicidal since age 7.  The last 2 years were exhausting trying to stay ahead of the suicidal pull in spite of entering therapy &amp; getting medicated. I finally asked my psychiatrist for ANY aggressive treatment -- regardless of the severity of the side effects -- because I was going to lose the battle. He asked me to try Lithium, first. Within a month, I had ZERO desire to kill myself. Side effects: Major leg tremors (I take Effexor). I feel a little flat, but NO complaints; I can't REMEMBER the last time I wasn't suicidal, DAILY. I'm STUNNED at how this alternative feels &amp; am glad I held on long enough to experience it.",9,140,2
"Lithium","sues1066","October 8, 2013","-","Have suffered with clinical depression for fifteen years and have been on numerous antidepressants. Have now been taking lithium for 9 months and have had a lot of problems including hands shaking, legs feeling as though they are going to give way a lot of the time, whole body feeling heavy, nausea, parts of my body suddenly jerking, sweating, but worst of all I feel as though I have had a personality transplant and do not recognize the agitated person I have become, the nightmares, my partner is very concerned.  I am reducing the dose to come off it. I have just noticed on this site that it has a high interaction risk if taken with venlafaxine which I have been prescribed with it at the same time.",1,50,2
"Lithium","lsrigg","August 20, 2013","Taken for 10 years or more","Started Lithium in 1986.  This has been my bedrock since then.  In 2011 my doctor added Wellbutrin because I was sub-clinically depressed and felt stuck.",10,60,2
"Lithium","123Katherine123","August 6, 2013","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was on many anti-depressants and none of them helped with my suicidal thoughts except lithium. Some medications I was on made me better, but very flat and emotionless. For me, lithium only takes the sharp edges off the bad emotions and leaves room for good (but not manic) ones. I had slight hand tremors for about a year after starting this, which was annoying but not incapacitating. They are gone now. I also gained about 10 pounds during the first few months, but lost it easily and I am now lighter than when I started. People used to tell me: Oh you'll gain so much weight, but it is mostly water weight because you get very thirsty. Overall, my quality of life is much, much better. Also you can safely stay on lithium for years.",10,138,2

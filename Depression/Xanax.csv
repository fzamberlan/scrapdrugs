"Xanax","Charo","January 12, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I’m sorry my Dr ever put me on Xanax.  It’s a EVIL drug . If your dr puts you on it more than a few weeks your will have a Xanax addiction . It’s not safe . Read up on  Xanax. This will be my third relapse it’s not in your mind I almost died twice trying to get off of Xanax my heart stopped 6 times and 5 seizures . Other Benzos are safer . The Drs are at fault not the company Pfizer has a warning no more than  two weeks on Xanax.",1,19,1

"Xanax","Gr","August 11, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","For anxiety I give it 10, but for depression 1.  It is very good medicine for GAD..but after a couple of months you get addicted.  If you stop insomnia is terrible and brain doesn't function at all..so be aware of that.",1,29,1
"Xanax","MicroMacroUniverse","February 11, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","It surely works for anxiety. Being said that, stay away from this drug if you can. In the time you build a tolerance, and doses required are much much higher as time passes. Withdrawal is TERRIBLE, I would give a 0/10 but I give 4 because at least it works for anxiety. You can suffer severe loss of memory and generally my brain can't work properly after too many years under it's effect, it has ruined my clear thinking. My liver values goes off chart when I use too much, and has became the norm now after few years of use. Go for other medication that doesn't give you that severe addiction. Hope it helps. Sorry for bad english. I'm now under Testosterone treatment and after few months I can see my symptoms gets better without the brain fog xanax can give.",4,34,1
"Xanax","Lakotka","January 5, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","I was initially diagnosed with severe depression. It was the drug of first choice to treat my extreme shyness. While on it I had troubles breathing. I was so dizzy and confused that at times I didn't even know where I was. I couldn't do anything. All I did was sleep. I was supposed to take it 3x a day but stopped before completing the treatment. Wouldn't recommend the experience to anyone. I honestly can't tell why some people take it for kicks or how they end up being addicted to it.",2,12,1

Experienced a rapid heartbeat at first, but chose to give it a chance anyway and after 2 weeks it was back to normal. Now I take Xanax 0.5 and Bupropion 300mg a day for my depression and anxiety. I can tell it really has changed my life so far, I can feel joy or calmness again (before I couldn't at all). I hope to get back to normal soon. Can't even describe how I'm glad I've started to take these medications. Although I know many people have severe side effects, the thing is - it's very individual, you have to try and find a medicine that works best for you. Many people take Prozac, but I almost died when took it - side effects were terrible, I even experienced hallucinations.",10,60,1
"Xanax","Luvdae","May 11, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","I started xanax 14 yrs ago after taking klonopin for years. My life changed for the better instantly. Before xanax I was trapped in my own mind constantly worrying instead of enjoying my family! It has now become a curse. For years been on 4 mg daily and I have severe panic attacks, depression, and insomnia. 50mg of trazodone for insomnia is not helping so I use my xanax to sleep, then I run out early leading to detox.  I'm just going in circles! Discussed with my family about going to a detox center and starting over with other meds.",10,41,1
"Xanax","Bently Rose","February 19, 2017","-","From 2002-2017 I have been on many different types of medications klonopin, Valium and xanax, not to mention all the psych drugs none that helped until my Dr. realized I had social anxiety and paralyzing panic attacks. By far the the best for not only my depression but my anxiety as well was xanax 2mg. I had to take at least the full bar to ease my anxiety however not only did it help with my fears and anxiety but it helped with my depression which stemmed from my constant panic attacks. It is easily abused however when it's needed it's a savior and can help me get what I need to accomplish done as a mother a wife and a personal trainer/ lifeguard and graduate of Homeland Security and Emergency management which without xanax I wouldn't have",0,95,1

Im gay and my life was not easy at all, my dad doesnt support me and then i got also depression. I take this medication for about 2 years now and i can tell you: it works so good and it saved my life. I was afraid of going out in public, working, etc. My life was terrible with all my anxiety attacks and that was destroying my life. If you feel the same, talk to your doc and ask for xanax, but DO NOT TAKE without prescription. IT IS a drug and you must control it!!!!",10,60,1

Eventually things were to tough and I was in one of the darkest points of my life. So I broke down and talk with my doctor about giving it a try. It totally changed my life. It helped me to focus more at work. It helped manage my anxiety so my mind could rest and I could sleep.

I do not like that it makes me loopy by taking my prescibed mg, and if I cut it in half I feel that it doesn't work at all. Xanax works very well for short term anxiety and if highly addictive so it is best to take it when you absolutely NEED it.

"Xanax","Bushygoodness","March 15, 2016","-","If I could rate Xanax higher I would, this is without a doubt the most effective medication I've ever taken for anxiety, and fast acting. I've always dealt with the public speaking anxiety since high school. I'm 29, healthy and active and have never been depressed so that's why I've been reluctant about SSRI's. My GP prescribed Celxa, went up to 20mg and it was a nightmare, had panic attacks and very vivid intrusive thoughts. My GP switched to lexapro @10mg and I still get panic attacks. If I get a panic attack I take a .50mg of Xanax and it takes like 15 min to kick in and I feel great - I hate SSRI's and wish Xanax was a daily med.",10,83,1

I am just so incredibly grateful that I was able to build a trusting relationship with my doctor so that HE feels comfortable prescribing it.  Xanax really is the only thing that helps me untangle myself when the anxiety takes over. What I love the most is that I can count on it to do the job and not leave me feeling strange later. It just smooths out the wrinkles and kinks that I get into every so often. Just knowing that I have it in my cabinet to lean on is in itself a big help for me - my secret tool. Yes, it's a shame something so helpful to us is abused, but that is with everything in life. Be happy we aren't Guinea pigs anymore with the crappy meds :-)",10,91,1

My mother had it with the Drs changing my dose and meds so finally she gave me some of her own prescribed xanax. She gave me a .25 when I had my bad day about 7 days out of the month now as needed. I also have nervous habits, anxiety. When she started giving me the xanax I was 17. Before I would cry hysterically for hours on end. As soon as I tried xanax it all went away. No more mood swings my depression went way down only having a few issues a month when I was untreated. I am now 28 and I use it maybe 4-6 times a year and I use oils the others. I highly recommend not using it continuously.",9,67,1

She takes two 1mg when she is having a really bad day which is about every other day. It knock her out for about four hours. Often times she will wake up and then about 4 hours later, she needs to take another Xanex. It helps in emergencies but does nothing for the underlying cause of her severe depression and anxiety. I'm glad it's there for emergencies though. I wish it did something to decrease the frequency of emergencies.",6,42,1

It's awful that people use it recreationally and that's made it difficult to get a prescription for it because of others abuse of it. It makes me feel normal. So obviously I need it. I have nothing but good things to say about this drug. It helps me not want to freak out and shake due to anxiety. If you really need to be on it, it's amazing.",10,164,1

It took 3 months to figure out what was going on.  The neurosurgeon prescribed it to me and told me to take it immediately and call back in 30 minutes.  O M G!!!   What a miracle that was.  I took it for 2 months, switch to Zoloft, then back to the Cigs.  Thank God for E-Cigs.   Now several years later.  Tinnitus hit me.   Mine is very weird as it comes and goes in cycles.

I have been in re-hab 4 times trying to get off of xanax. They give you valium, librium or ativan so you don’t have a seizure and then lower that dosage over 7-15 days and release you. But 3-7 days later your symptoms are going to be so bad it will drive you back to xanax which now you will probably have to buy on the street because they’re widely available unlike valium.",1,66,2

I have dealt with these issues pretty much since kindergarten. Well mainly the extreme social phobia/anxiety at that time which they used to just call shy. When I was 18 and was seeing a psychologist he diagnosed me as having agoraphobia, I'm guessing because they really didn't have the term social phobia/anxiety at that time. I finally started taking Paxil and it worked good for 10 yrs then I maxed out on dosage and it stopped working. Tried all the other SSRI's/SSNRI's. Effexor XR worked best but didn't help anxiety/or social phobia issues. Got on Klonopin, then Xanax eventually. Benzodiazepines are life savers for socialphobia.",10,107,2

I rarely take it, but I've Taken trips I never thought I would be able to take. Get this, I was even able to skydive!  Not bad for an agoraphobic.  It builds confidence. Just having it in my pocket really helps. I had to take a .5 mg dose tonight because I've been in panic mode for five days and I  finally needed to reset my mental state.

I learned over the years that if I could keep my anxiety/panic under good control I would be much less likely to go into depression (uncontrolled anxiety greatly increases the chance I will experience depression). Xanax works extremely well at keeping my anxiety (and hence depression) under control. These days I don't need to use it continuously because just knowing that Xanax is there and works so well if I need it has a calming effect. I didn't give Xanax 10/10 though because it has one annoying side effect for me: it kills my libido rather effectively if I take it for a few days.

I haven't felt this good about myself in a long time.  Sometimes I would get a panic attack just from walking in a public place, such as a supermarket, and then came the heavy breathing and the nervous feeling out of nowhere.

"Xanax","quirky1","January 1, 2009","-","I love Xanax. I wish I could take it daily but my doctor won't prescribe it to me for daily use, because she doesn't want me to get addicted to it.  I only take Xanax on rare occasions, when I was extremely distraught.  It made me feel better instantly. I've only taken 25 mg, but that was more than enough to make everything seem great.  I was aware that my problems still existed, but I wasn't overwhelmed by them.  It made me feel warm and happy.  I've taken other drugs before and Xanax is by far, the best choice.",10,99,3
"Xanax","makes a big difference","December 14, 2008","-","I am being treated for severe depression. I take 150mg of Zoloft once a day and 1mg of Xanax a day. It has taken me a long time to get on medication for my condition but I am glad I decided to now. I feel completely calm and haven't felt depressed since I started taking both of these. It's been 4 months now.",10,55,3
"Xanax","Anonymous","October 21, 2008","-","I have severe depression and general anxiety disorder.  I take 100mg/day of Zoloft, and that pretty well takes care of my depression, and most of my panic attacks.  Occasionally, I'll take 0.25mg for a panic attack, but I'm cautious because sometimes the downside of coming off a panic attack sends me into a fit of depression.  I highly recommend both Zoloft and Xanax, I just want to put the word out there to use good judgement when treating a panic attack when you have depression as well.",8,63,3

With the drug therapy I was on, I had thoughts of killing myself, long bouts of depression, endless sleepless nights, nightsweats, violent behavior, an all round terrible person to be around. Xanax saved my life and my marriage. Xanax helped me calm all of my side effects.",10,90,3

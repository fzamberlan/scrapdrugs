"Wellbutrin SR","partridge","May 29, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I was prescribed Wellbutrin SR as a boost for my regular antidepressant (I have seasonal affective disorder), since I am at the top-end of the dosing and didn't feel comfortable increasing.  Overall excellent medication. I don't notice many side effects and it has helped to increase my energy/mood enough to make it bearable during the winter months.  If I miss a dose, I get a headache which does grow into a migraine if left unchecked.",8,3,1
"Wellbutrin SR","isa","April 24, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I've been taking  Wellbutrin 150mg SR (generic) once a day for the past 6 months.  I have had no negative side effects.  It was originally prescribed to treat my Binge Eating disorder but it did nothing for it.  BUT it did improve my depressed moods drastically! No needing check lists anymore to prompt me to do all the basic stuff a normal human being should be doing, like take a shower.. So for about 5 months I was not depressed anymore, I was also less anxious and had less intrusive thoughts.  I now think,  one month later (so after 6 months), that I should bump it to twice a day (like it's intended in the first place anyways) because my depression and intrusive thoughts are slowing coming back and ruining my attempts at self-care. In the past I took Paxil and Effexor.  Paxil never worked.  Effexor worked for a while (with bad side effects), then stopped working for me.  I hope I have now found what will work for me long term!",10,15,1

Insane migraine headaches, stomach pain nausea, ear pain, ringing in the ears, vision problems, vertigo, suicidal thoughts. I also had very frequent urination. The agitation  and angry outbursts were really frightening. I was completely fine for 3 months so I didn’t make the connection between the drug and the symptoms at all. I went to doctors for headaches and my bladder and even for allergies until I figured it out myself. I finally thought to myself, what did I start doing differently in my life? It was the Wellbutrin. I called my psychiatrist and told him my symptoms and he told me to stop taking it immediately. I’m glad I figured it out. I really don’t think anybody else other than myself would have. It has been a really rough few weeks with this pain. I felt almost immediately better when I stopped the medication.",1,26,1

Cramps and body aches were gone.  Worry about the PMDD  gone.  Depression -gone. I had a lot more energy!   I really was soo happy until I realized that my face HURT with raw deep acne lesions.  My forehead was completely covered (never happened before in my life) as was the rest of my face (usually only on chin and jaw areas at PMS time).  I did experience bad  ringing in my ears for the first 3 weeks and it was tougher getting to sleep.  I could handle all that but not the pizza face.  Too bad:(  I also experienced hair thinning but that could be from PMDD.  I'm not waiting it out and letting my skin continue to scar.",7,18,1

After a month I'd say it settled a bit , my depression has gone totally. I was so negative before, I complained so much  and started to cry in secret. It stopped completely and it works fast - I'd say immediately. Best thing for me was my life long issues with food, over eating and sugar binges just vanished. I couldn't believe It. I lost 5 kilos quickly, my appetite came back but still I don't binge on sugar. I have to watch what I eat but thank goodness I don't have the obsession with food anymore . Also stopped smoking after a few days and now I can't believe I ever smoked yuck . Over all it's a miracle drug that is life changing .

"Wellbutrin SR","byn","January 16, 2018","-","Took me 2 tries to get on it, first time I tried it, it sent me into a anxiety attack for the 3 days and had to stop. I think this was my own nerves though. Waited a couple months, then tried again. This time it went much better, the first 4 days had a lot of head fogginess &amp; jitters, but otherwise not too bad. After that, suddenly I felt much better! My mood improved a bit, I had much more energy (I wasn't getting that mid-day crash anymore), and I was getting less headaches. But the cons of it were constipation, mild moodiness, and anxiety in the evening and towards going to sleep for some reason .

If you want lots of energy this is the stuff to take. If you have OCD or an anxiety disorder you might want to pair this with some Effexor or Zoloft.  I'm still in the process of figuring out a dose that works good for me.  I'm on 450mg xl and 75mg Effexor xl.  If you want to drink alcohol keep it to a minimum preferably no more than 3 beers I personally find that it reduces my desire to drink and I'm also going to ask doctor about taking Contrave which is 300 mg Wellbutrin and 12.5 mg Naltrexone for weight loss (Thanks Effexor)",6,15,1

After 3 weeks, I started 300 mg SR and I definitely noticed a change. I had a lot more energy, starting doing things I once enjoyed, and did better in my college classes. With weight loss, I lost 16 pounds after the first 2 weeks of taking the 300mg SR. Overall, wellbutrin has worked so well for me and has helped reduced my depression and anxiety. 10/10",0,51,1

The first few months were great, I had more energy energy, I lost weight, and I felt great.

Serotonin (key in SSRIs) actually suppresses dopamine and inhibits feelings. This dopamine and norepinephrine (a stimulant) reuptake inhibitor can help and and DRIVE without sexual side effects, weight gain, and apathy caused by SSRIs.

I wanted so bad to stop taking it but Very glad I didn't. I feel great now and have lost 15lbs. The Sex drive has come back full force. Advice: take benadryl those first few weeks to help you sleep.

Was ok for a few weeks and boom, super depressed, suicidal, the works. So I was prescribed wellbutrin and mirtazepine for sleep. The wellbutrin worked right away and mirtazepine was great for sleep.

Found that I needed to take with meals to avoid jitters and make sure I took second dose before 4pm to avoid sleep issues. Very mild constipation, stools just seem harder. The good part- I don't feel medicated at all. I don't cry all the time anymore. I started to notice that I was actually enjoying life and events. I completely stopped needing alcohol and/or food to fill an emotional void. It was amazing for me what this change in outlook did for my sex life - I want sex regularly and hang ups I used to have disappeared. Caution - one generic manufacturer did not work at all. Use only brand or Sandoz!",10,103,2

Was told that Wellbutrin would be a good option and that it was fairly mild. The first few days had the euphoric feeling everyone talks about, but this ended in 2-3 days. After that anger kicked in to the point where I was taking walks at 1am to calm down and relax. From there the weirdness kicked in. A feeling that's hard to describe but life got very flat. Didn't feel anything, just flat. I felt like I had a lobotomy or something. At a party last week a friend asked if I was stoned as I looked out of it. Then I forgot to take it one day and I felt great that day, joy, emptions, had fun. I then took it the next day and felt horrible.  Cold turkey and happy, not for me",3,36,2

My pulse was 115 and blood pressure was high (never ever is) it just shot up. The doctor said I was having a panic attack and that it is due to the medication.

"Prozac","Anonymous","April 7, 2020","-","I take Prozac because I have stomach issues of nausea. I have been on 40 mg for sometime now. I really do remember having many side effects except that it made me tired.  It is suppose to be a happy pill.  I will go off of it for a week or two and I do not notice of my being unhappy or being happy when I go back on it.  When I go off it because i am too lazy to get it filled, after about a week or two, i feel like i am coming down with the flu, i.e., body aches....even to my fingers, shoulders....all over.  As far as making one tired, I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and need a lot of sleep and still feel like I need more. I just zonk out.  So I did not notice any ill effects in taking this drug.",10,14,1

It wasn’t doing much for me so I missed a day or two, then would take one, and that was a big mistake. It completely sent me down hill. Out of absolutely no where I was crying every second of the day, having suicidal thoughts. It took 2 weeks to be somewhat back to normal but after that I never got any better. Prozac made me  feel suicidal and gave me depression that I didn’t have before. 2 months off of it, I still feel the same. It seriously messed up my head.

I had a little nausea, weight gain, sleeping more and felt like less energy but for once I was content and happy. I dealt with loss of a child and father of my kids at 22. I never sought out help or treatment until last year. I finally drew a line with my depression and anger. Felt like a crappy parent. This medication has had its side effects. My biggest notice was my sexual desire was 100% no longer. I had tried dating but had no desire to talk, touch or be intimate. When I was having sex was somewhat uncomfortable and had a hard time with lubrication. I also found it hard to climax. I read up and this is a side effect with fluoxetine. I didn't care though.

Started on Prozac in around July even though my mum wasn't too keen, I made my choice. Side effects were horrible let me tell you!! I was nauseous all day for a week and a half and ate a little to nothing - lost 4kgs. But after that, it was fine. And 3 months later I started feeling amazing, literally. Thinking about how depressed I was made me feel sick to my stomach, shows how much I have achieved happiness. I now don't feel so low, and it's a pretty good feeling. I do wish I had tried natural methods a bit more longer but I had no time to waste being depressed and so I don't regret taking it.

I have been on and off it/trying other options since then &amp; nothing has helped as much. Zoloft &amp; Paxil did not have an impact. I stopped taking it after feeling better for a long time but my depression came back and was much worse, now finally getting it under control. I personally don't like taking any medicine but this one has helped me a great deal-the side effects (especially being really tired) at least for me went away after the first month.

The only side effect I don't like is the heartburn so you have to drink a big glass of water when you take it, otherwise you feel like your esophagus is on fire. I've had no other negative side effects.  It also helped me quit smoking and my craving for sweets. I'm sticking to this med forever..",10,73,1

I personally would never go above 30 mg, trust me on that one.  Also, because it has a super long half-life it is easier to stop taking it.",9,46,1

I initially started on 20mg and the first 3-4 weeks were tough with the side effects... but once you get past this, the Prozac works wonders. I increased to 40 mg but found it too much so cut back down. Now, 7 years on, I’ve been on 20mg for around 3 years and again the side effects for the first few weeks were tough. I’ve today increased to 40mg and I think I felt very unwell initially- but I’m going to stick with it. One thing I found is if I drink quite heavily then this would completely negate the anti depressant, leaving me incredibly low. So monitor how much you are drinking if possible, especially on 40mg.",8,51,2

"Prozac","Gina","September 17, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My 16 year old daughter became extremely anxious over the summer. She received counseling and continued getting more anxious and depressed and then she didn’t want to live anymore. This was a complete change from her normal positive and active life. She was prescribed Lexapro which at first we thought was helping her anxiety. After a couple weeks it made her extremely depressed and incredibly sleepy. Her psychiatrist changed her medication to 40 mg of Prozac and within 5 days, we saw a huge change in her mood. She’s got energy and is active once again. She feels happy and is talkative and zany like she used to be. We still have a long way to go with therapy and dealing with life’s anxiety but she is now able to function and has hope. I want to encourage anyone who feels defeated. Hold on, be patient and keep trying different medications.

It has worked in making me feel safe and able to enjoy doing things again. The longest  I have been on it is 3 months. My advice would be to stay on it for longer than 6 months to see the fool effects but if you feel healed then consider stopping it just so you are not dependent on a pill. Every depression episode is different it may work faster sometimes it may also make you feel worse at first, you may get headaches, feel sick from your stomach. Sometimes we tend to be stubborn and stop taking the medicine making us go through suffering again. My advice is take it change your thoughts into positive ones and try as best as you can to stop overthinking instead enjoy everyday life. God bless you all.",8,73,2

I have had an incredible experience with this drug. I've been on it for four months and feel like the Gwenn I was years ago. If you are stopping yourself from trying this medication for similar reasons, I hope you will reconsider. Initially, it was difficult as my body adjusted to the medication but I expected that as my doctor told me the first few weeks can be challenging.

"Prozac","Liam","July 15, 2019","-","After a few months on Prozac, I no longer  the depressed version of myself that I was before Prozac. Happiness was something I rarely felt, and now feel daily - and I was never excited by anything ever, and now am so positive and excited for my future plans and goals! I do feel almost ‘cured’ of major depression. The first couple of weeks were a struggle, and I did feel worse before I felt better - I felt more dark and depressed than I ever have - so it’s very important you have a plan in place if this does happen, a friend/counsellor/doctor you can talk to for example. I then felt very numbed out and had very low libido, which lasted a couple weeks but did also stop for me. My libido is still less than it used to be now, but for me it’s not an issue as I was annoyed with how high it was before.

I slowly had happier thoughts. After a month my dosage was increased to 20 mg and the first week of that I actually started feeling a little depressed again, but after a week and a half my mood elevated. I started getting involved in activities again. I started hanging out with my family and friends again. I make an effort to do my hair &amp; makeup, work out,  work on goals... I’m back to me.

My thinking was clearer, it was a happy feeling and the only reason I stopped taking it at that time was I couldn't sleep much many nights with all that energy!!

"Prozac","Helpyouandme","May 10, 2019","-","I’ve suffered from depression since a teen and now in my 30’s. I’ve taken Prozac a couple of times with success, the problem being as soon as I feel good again I feel like maybe I wasn’t bad off to begin with and stop  I would think I was in a good spot. Decent marriage, good kids, great job-and I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t be happy and grateful.  I got to the point where I had no feelings and wanted to hurt myself. Outside of reading-inspiring books and literally peeling myself from the bed in the darkest of moments, Prozac really helped me. It took weeks, very painful weeks. Once it kicked it I became interested in my life again.  I’m in a good spot right now and I believe it’s because I listened to other success stories and kicked myself out of bed everyday regardless of how much I wanted to crawl under my covers.

Never in a million years did I think I would ever be able to go somewhere by myself or sit by myself at a table in a place full of people ever again. I can leave my bed again. I can leave my HOUSE again. This medicine has given me the first taste of life I've had in years. My depression was agitative, so I'm also on a dose of carbamazepine on the side which in conjunction has done so much for me. My friends barely recognize me.

"Prozac","Anonymous","April 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Prozac was prescribed to our 15 year old for dysthymia &amp; suicidal ideation.

Psychiatrist told us to push through the side effects, which included a day time hallucination, teeth clenching, eye pain, hand tremors. We got to week 8. Suicidal thoughts increased and became more compulsive frightening our child. We are now withdrawing and visited a different GP who advised meditation, yoga &amp; exercise as well as precursors for serotonin that are amino acids from health store - which no medical profession tells you about before trying Prozac .

This drug is just not for those people who can get really sensitive to extra serotonin in their body, like I was. I would really recommend talking to your healthcare provider first.

The only relatively fast effect I had with this med was improvement in my ability to fall asleep and the quality of the sleep I got also improved within 2 weeks. Early side effects were appetite loss, a slight increase in breakouts (face), excessive yawning, desire for alcohol decreased but increased interest in recreational mari, stomach upset, headaches. Sounds like a lot but every med has its acclimation period. This one is just particularly long. After about 2 months, it helped me recognize and face my depression, and manage my anxiety really well. But, latent side effects for me were increased appetite, decreased libido, worsening brain fog, and stomach upset.

I went up to 30 mg and then 40 mg after a few months,  which I am still taking to this day. I have tried to come off of Prozac and unfortunately I am just not ready. Which is okay! Prozac has been such a wonderful option for me. It feels great not wanting to hurt yourself all of the time. I can’t remember the last time I had suicidal thoughts.

I sleep like 10 hours a night and end up taking a nap most days too. Prior to going on Prozac I was dealing with a lot of anxiety/agoraphobia but still had some motivation to do fun things or work on personal projects. Now I feel like everyday is just a slog to get through, that I need to occupy my brain somehow until I can go back to sleep.  Prozac has made my suicidal thoughts a lot more frequent. I get very little enjoyment out of life and it feels like there's nothing to look forward to. I have no plan to act on these thoughts, but the increase led me to stop taking Prozac a week ago.

The 'noise' in my head (the horrible things it says) go nearly silent. My ears still ring a lot but not as much as before. I'm a little jittery, but I attribute that to a new exercise program I'm using as another part of the solution.  The feeling I get about an hour after taking the pill is a sense of peace. The world appears a little brighter, and my tunnel vision subsides and the negative thoughts go mostly silent. I still have my spark while taking this drug too, which means I still have a sense of humor and can plan for the future. I still care about things, which is cool.

The thoughts and problems that usually fill in my head don't affect me as much anymore and I get over things much quicker, which has led to decreasing my stress and my severe anxiety. I've also felt very calm and mellow, which could turn some people off but for me it has been a blessing. I've always not been able to stay still or focus, and am very scatterbrained, so this is a huge change that I've welcomed.

The nightmares every single night was what made my doctor know that Prozac wasn't for me..

That time it was a lifesaver! I felt my mood lift alot after a week, then even more after a month. These results lasted for several yrs with some sexual side effects, but less than with Zoloft &amp; Lexapro (which also caused waking WIRED every 4 hrs).

My story - in short - is anxiety has plagued me since my teens, depression joined the parade in my late teens/early 20's. I have tried several medications over the years and because they either made me flat or sick I didn't stick with them. Recently decided Prozac would be my last attempt. I started taking 20 mg every morning 2 weeks ago. I have had very little in the way of side effects. Some mind shakiness in the morning, little bit of difficulty falling asleep, mild fatigue, and dampened appetite. The benefits - to this point - are - surprising. I am much calmer, the anxiety is 80% gone, the depression is still present but not like 2 weeks ago and before. It's dissipating for sure. Life doesn't look so all or nothing which is a nice change. My spouse said my fidgets are gone. I was almost constantly moving in some form or another.

I am able to better care for myself now thus able to care better for my spouse. I have no plans to stop the Prozac.

Dealing with major depression all my life, this is the 1st time I've ever taken a drug for it. The feeling didn't last all night but, I realize it takes time for this to kick in. For once in my life I am very hopeful.",0,59,15
"Prozac","My experience","May 8, 2009","-","I have depression. Prozac did not help me. After 4 weeks and several side effects, the only positive experience was the fact that I didn't feel anything bad or good. The worst was the major lack of motivation and loss of all interest in what I enjoyed in life. That was kind of the problem before the medicine. This is my second day off Prozac and I feel better each day. Good luck all.",2,24,15
"Prozac","MrsVengeance","April 29, 2009","-","I have been taking this medication since 1-16-09. So far people around me have noticed a change but I still don't see a change that is so dramatic that I should continue using this medicine. I still feel extremely low at times and all they do is keep increasing my dosage.",6,15,15

"Prozac","Anonymous","April 12, 2009","-","I took Prozac for several years to treat my depression and it was awesome. It had few side effects but gave me my life back. I went from not leaving my bed to actually being a productive member of society again. I did lose a good deal of weight while I was on it but that eventually balanced out.  I took it until it got to the point where it stopped working for me and I've never found anything that has worked as well.  Hopefully I will be able to take it and have it work for me again one day.",10,187,15

I returned from from a tour in Iraq about three months ago and my symptoms kept getting worse and worse.  I've been taking Prozac for about a week now and I'm already feeling relief from it. It's like all the problems are still there, they just dont get to me like they used to. It's been very helpful so far.",10,323,16

"Esketamine","J","June 6, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 On Spravato I felt like I was going to die. It took 4 minutes to kick in. I couldn’t feel my face, couldn’t speak, couldn’t breathe, the room was spinning, music felt far away even though I had headphones in. I heard the ocean. I was sweating/ felt like I was sinking, mind racing, nauseous. I felt like I was strapped to a Ferris wheel that wouldn’t stop spinning/falling really fast. I was crying &amp; sweating, 22 minutes in I had a ringing in my ear. It gave me a headache. I couldn’t hear my music anymore, that scared me. I couldn’t move. I was crying for my mom. It was really scary. I don’t feel 100% back to normal today (appointment was yesterday). I feel lethargic- spacey with  no appetite. I feel sad/disappointed that this didn’t work. This was literally the last thing to try treatment wise. I have to go back to doing TMS everyday. Please don’t try this unless it’s your LAST resort.",0,3,1
"Esketamine","Stephanie","May 24, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 Details: a medium intranasal dose twice a week in office for a month, followed by a high dose once a week. Not a cure. If you stop, your depression will return. Experience: spray a mist of Spravato into each nostril while at the office. You then need to wait two hours to be monitored for the effects to wear off. For me, the first 20 minutes are unpleasant, like a psychadelic trip that is a bit too strong. Due to COVID-19, I cannot bring anyone with me, so I listen to guided meditations. I have vomited on the higher dose, but an accompanying zofran has helped tremendously.  In my bag: water bottle, crackers, hard candy, a book. The nasal spray drips down your throat and tastes terrible.  Results: Spravato has helped me tremendously. I am 36, and have had depression since I was 12. I have tried many medications, with only minor results (including TMS). The appointments are unpleasant for me, but they are worth it for the relief. It was about two months before I saw results.",0,5,1

"Esketamine","Eddie","March 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Have been in a esketamine trial for nearly two years. Has been quite helpful. I have experienced only one real bad downtime(when getting out of bed is difficult, etc..) and it was much shorter, a few weeks compared to my normal of months. While the drug hasn't brought me up to where I want to be, it has really limited the bottoming out. I was in a very low state when I first started taking it and am much more functional.",9,3,1
"Esketamine","Spunkygirl8","February 4, 2020","-","9 treatments. first three weeks, I felt some improvement.  laughing, having motivation. Once a week and feel less depressed for 3 days .Then depressed. Treatment  feels amazing! Had IV infusions very intense! I couldn't feel my body. Crazy hallucinations nothing scary. Enjoyable. Spravato I feel  relaxed like the Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb! No visual disturbances. Listen to Simon and Garfunkel mellow but upbeat. No rock! I can feel my body, hearing is more sensitive. Music sounds great! Definitely a nasty taste in throat. Candy helps. I stop feeling the effects after 1 hour, drowsy hour 2. Then normal but rest at home. Headphones and playlist, bring a soft blanket, and eye mask. the experience is becoming less pleasurable. Antidepressant effect has been minimal. I wish I more IV was less $. Pure Ketamine is very helpful. For Spravato they've taken away one of the molecules. Research it please",4,3,1
"Esketamine","Danchise","February 3, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 When I read about Spravato I was so excited. I had failed TMS and multiple oral medications so this new format of spraying something directly into your brain. Initially I had a great amount of disassociation for the first hour, which gradually dissipated.  The day of the treatment I felt great, but then it seemed to just go away. While on it I had increased suicidal ideations.  I was also hospitalized 2 months later with pneumonia and fluid in my lower left lung. THESE TWO COULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION TO EACH OTHER.  But after that I elected to stop taking Spravato. I think it is very promising but it is too new to have a history and I’m done being the guinea pig",0,6,1

"Esketamine","Mick","January 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started taking Spravato nearly two months ago.  Started at the 56 mg loading dose.  At four weeks it had done nothing positive.  So the doc upped it to the 84.  First off that first double dose treatment had me on one hell of a trip.  I really felt that I wasn’t coming back! After that treatment I was hung over, then treatment 2.  After that I was sick as dog.  Severe headaches and terrible nausea.  Took me 5 days to recoup and as of today still with the headaches and nausea.  Called the doc and stopped treatment altogether.  I just can spend day after day feeling sick, not able to work, etc.  This was a last ditch effort and now I don’t know just what I am going to do.",1,6,1
"Esketamine","Baldfun","January 19, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 After being on 6 different anti depressants and doing 6 weeks of TMS with no relief from my depression I was prescribed Spravato. I completed 4 weeks of treatments of 84mg 2 times per week, 4 weeks of treatments one times per week and one treatment every other week. I have had no relief from my depression. I feel like the effectiveness of this drug was over hyped. It was expensive and time consuming and very disappointing to have no results.",0,12,1
"Esketamine","AJ","January 18, 2020","-","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 I did the IV Ketamine for several months and found it very helpful, but it wore off very quickly.  My physician has recommended that I start Spravato, as he has sometimes seen its benefits last longer.  I have now had 2 treatments with 53 mg.  I do not feel dissociative symptoms, like with the IV, but I have significant symptoms of motion sickness.  The night of the treatment, I feel exhausted and this is lasting into the following day.  With the IV treatment, my symptoms fully resolved the night of treatment.  I am trying to determine if these treatments are worth continuing.  The side effects are prolonged and there is no certainty that the benefits will last very long.",0,12,1

The day after my third treatment (first at 84 mg) I felt the darkness lifting. My depression score went from severe depression to mild mood disturbance. I haven’t felt normal in six years. Tried dozens of meds, and nothing. I’m still not 100%, but so much better. I don’t dread my life anymore. The crushing sadness is gone. I know everyone responds differently, but for me it’s been life-changing.",0,32,1

"Esketamine","SpravatoUserNY","December 6, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 Hi, I think people who are taking Spravato should read the wealth of information from maker. I have severe anxiety.  It does not assist anxiety.  If you have a doctor giving you Spravato for severe anxiety- that’s insane!   Spravato is for depression only. Take the dose, relax and you absolutely want to be alone, lights off and listen to music YOU LIKE.  Do not sit in a lighted room with the clinician.  They will come and check on you. I do not recommend you bring a family member while the medication is working.  If you can stand go to the bathroom if you have to.  If you can’t stand - ask for help.   Having to use the bathroom takes the entire process of reprogramming your brain away. Urination- yes it is more difficult on Spravato. Going #2- Your not suppose to eat food at least 2 hours before taking meds. Is it worth it?  Yes!!  Does it last forever?  No but as I get more and more doses it is working longer and longer. I hope this helps someone else.",0,40,1
"Esketamine","RFM","December 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 An update from September I've been on Spravato for over three months now and it seems to be helping although I'm still not seeing rainbows.  It works best for me about 48 hours after a visit.  My experiences are all over the place.  If you clean your sinuses before your visit it's effects are a lot stronger.  I had some bizarre reactions.  One of the weirdest was the feeling of melting into the floor and then the floor dropping out. It also causes me to have a strong urge to urinate and messes with my sense of taste.  The vision issues have more or less subsided.  Take some candy to the appointment, preferably Life Savers wintergreen or peppermint.  Nothing you can choke on.  Note:  When the cost is Ketamine infusions hits 200$ I'm going to switch.  Pure Ketamine is amazing.",0,12,1
"Esketamine","anonymous","November 26, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 I had my first experience with Spravato yesterday and the side effects were just awful. Felt extremely drunk--dissociation, severe nausea and sweating, dizziness, tiredness. Could barely make it home (I got a ride) and get myself into bed to lie there for the rest of the night. The next morning--extremely tired, nauseous. Felt hungover. No affect on my TRD (treatment resistant depression after 1 treatment. I will continue as long as I can stand it because I am pretty much out of options. But I am dreading it more than I did with ECT.",0,17,1

It may or may not work but I’m better than I was hope it lasts. I may try Kratom if this doesn’t work, do not want to be as bad as I was.

Was on 56mg 2x week for a month (eventually I had no immediate reaction as my body got used to the drug - lingering tiredness, so I did the treatments in the late afternoon) and have had 3 treatments with 84mg. First two of 84mg were fine - trippy, slight visual disturbance but I was able to recognize that this was the drug and not me - felt like I smoked a ton of pot or something. Yesterday was the 3rd treatment of 84mg. I went into appointment very upset and stressed, and coupled with the Spravato, had a dissociative episode. I started to cry and then boom: sobbing, no idea who I was, where I was, visual disturbance so couldn't see correctly, was paranoid, untrusting - I have never been so terrified in all my life. So far, no depression reduction, which saddens me, and I'm scared to have another trip like I did yesterday.",0,22,1

"Esketamine","Informant","September 24, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 People need to understand that no one is the same and that EVERYONE will have different reactions. Take me for example (then compare it to the experiences of others):  Diagnosis: MDD &amp; CPTSD Dose: 84mg Duration: 4+ months  Prior use of psychedelics: None   As for me, I’ve found substantial relief for the first time ever (42 years of age). I’ve had 2 experiences of disassociation, which were extremely pleasant, controllable and very mild, at best. At no time have I had any  out-of-body  experiences; no dizziness; no side effects at all — other than mild sedation afterwards (for approximately 20-30 minutes). TMS did NOT work, nor did ECT or DBT. Ketamine infusions worked well, that is until I developed severe UTI’s, kidney stones and a PSA level of 9.8! I could go on and on, but the point of this review is to show the lack of correlation between my experience and those of others.

If you want to skip the rubbish go for straight Ketamine.  That stuff is amazing. It's going to cost you $$.

I found that putting your head between your legs after you inject until it soaks in really amplifies the effects.  I'd use regular ketamine but my insurance won't cover it and at $400 a visit that's not going to happen.  I got approved to use Spravato for a year when needed and Jannsen Pharmaceutical is picking up my copay for now. They have a plan to pay for your medication if needed and 80,000$ net a year or less qualifies.  I'm plan on switching to rTMS by itself soon.

"Esketamine","Jake","September 1, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 I began treatments with 56 mg which is four sprays using two syringes. It did not help with my depression so after the fourth treatment (two weeks) the dosage was increased to 84 mg (6 sprays using three syringes).   For a week, I thought it might be helping a little, but came to realize it was not.  I did start having increased anxiety, often very anxious when waking in the morning.  After the first month of twice a week treatments and two additional weekly treatments, I stopped since I was convinced it was not helping my depression and was making me very anxious.  My depression now seems worse than ever and my anxiety is at a high level.  Spavato's Savings Plan reduced the cost of the medicine to only a co-pay of $10 per treatment.  However the doctor charged $300 per visit which was not covered by my insurance. If others try Spravato, I hope you have better results.  The doctor and staff were great and supportive.  It was disappointing for me.",0,13,1
"Esketamine","Anonymous","August 27, 2019","-","<b>Spravato (esketamine):</b>			 I posted my experience earlier and now I have done a total of 10 treatments of the nasal spray Spravato.  2 at 56mg and the rest at 84mg.  After sessions 6 I started to feel a little lighter and less depressed but this lasted very shortly.  The treatments after that did nothing for me.  They are very intense and you get awful disassociation, dizziness, numbness. Its a complete out of body experience. For me the feelings were very bothersome &amp; after I would leave I was done for the day.  I couldn’t do anything just lay around.  I guess if it worked for me I would have sucked it up &amp; continued even though the side effects were so bothersome.  Unfortunately for me this didn’t work and it cost me a fortune.  Personally I wouldn’t advise others to do this until there is more research about it.  It is still very new and drs are still learning by experimenting on us! However the one done by IV is not as new.  I will continue to fight the fight but will never do Spravato again.",0,11,1

Next day I felt like my head was full of mud, couldn't make any decisions, had a blank look on my face all day...didn't feel like I was in this world.  And the third session seemed to be somewhere in the middle. The side effects during and the evening of weren't too bad.  The next day I functioned and went to work like a typical day.

I went up to the 84mg dose on the 4th trip. Amazing experience, be prepared as well as you can ahead of time because it is intense. Mixed results so far but I have hope. I highly suggest you have a strong support system in place beforehand because you will need it. I unfortunately did not and I think that had a negative affect on my response. I spent one week totally alone I saw nobody except for my ride and my time in treatment. I definitely don’t recommend that for any of you and hope you have better success.

Well last week I began running again and feel a bit of the depression lifting.  I do not in any ways feel cured but I do feel a little better.

The drawback being that the effects and relief lasted days/weeks. But when it is working it is miraculous. Due to a good response to the Ketamine but not able to prolong the effects, Spravato was prescribed for me. I began week 1 with 2 treatments( required 2 treatments every week for first 4 weeks). It is much milder, less intense, and effective in my view based on my response. Both dosages were at 56mg, the required initial dose.

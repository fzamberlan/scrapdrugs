"Trimipramine","wildcat777","June 8, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I fail to comprehend why trimipramine is not prescribed more by doctors as I have found it to be the best tricyclic on the market. I am diagnosed with personality disorder, bi-polar condition, PTSD, anxiety and depression. I take Venlafaxine 375mg, Quetiapine 300mg, Trimipramine 200mg and Diazepam 20mg.   I have been mentally unwell for around 45 years and I have found that Trimipramine is the best tablet for sedation and insomnia, and it gives me enormous relief generally speaking. The only negative side is a very dry mouth, and I visit my dentist more frequently as the dry mouth can cause teeth decay.",9,5,1
"Trimipramine","Louise Howard","October 18, 2007","-","<b>Surmontil (trimipramine):</b>			 I take Surmontil for serious depression and anxiety.  Before taking Surmontil, I took paxil and a host of other medications.  None worked and my doctor suggested that I find another psychiatrist.  I did and was fortunated to find a doctor who understood my condition and prescribed Surmontil for me.  It saved my life.  However, it is no longer manufactured in the U.S. so I have to get it from a Canadian pharmacy, which is ok by me because there is nothing else that can help me.",0,68,1

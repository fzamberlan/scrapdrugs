This will be my third relapse it’s not in your mind I almost died twice trying to get off of Xanax my heart stopped 6 times and 5 seizures . Other Benzos are safer .

"Alprazolam","Anonymous","May 3, 2012","-","<b>Xanax (alprazolam):</b>			 I have been diagnosed with depression and panic disorder (for 20 years now). I learned over the years that if I could keep my anxiety/panic under good control I would be much less likely to go into depression (uncontrolled anxiety greatly increases the chance I will experience depression). Xanax works extremely well at keeping my anxiety (and hence depression) under control. These days I don't need to use it continuously because just knowing that Xanax is there and works so well if I need it has a calming effect. I didn't give Xanax 10/10 though because it has one annoying side effect for me: it kills my libido rather effectively if I take it for a few days. Apart from that, very tolerable - way more so than any antidepressant I was on.",0,116,3

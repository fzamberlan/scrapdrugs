"Cymbalta","jules","June 5, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I took a 30mg Cymbalta capsule at 9am at 9.30am it was like someone threw a brick at my head then I started to get brain zaps. I thought it would wear off but I started to get cramps, became very thirsty, vomiting, became uncoordinated and then called an ambulance. My sodium level dropped to 118 and I got hyponatremia. they took me straight to emergency dept and gave me a brain scan and a salty drink. I stayed in the emergency ward for 4 days and they said never to have cymbalta again or I could have a stroke or worse. I am a 58 year old healthy female  I would be very cautious taking this drug and definitely have someone with you who can take you to hospital if things go wrong as they did with me. I was lucky I still was thinking straight enough to call and ambulance. That saved my life.",1,11,1
"Cymbalta","GoobersMom","May 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on 60mg Duloxetine daily for 1 month, 30mg daily before that to wean off Effexor. The Duloxetine was so ineffective &amp; the withdrawal from the Effexor was so bad that I had to take both for about 6 weeks. Now with no Effexor I am back to feeling no effects from Duloxetine. I'm painfully depressed and have sudden bouts of extreme anger &amp; irritability. I cry all the time, have no appetite, and hate going out in public. I've been on every antidepressant on the market. With Duloxetine, I might as well be eating Tic Tacs.",1,6,1
"Cymbalta","Martinb","May 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I tried SSRI (paroxetine) for couple years on and off. I was off the drugs for couple years and then I decided to try SNRI drug first Effexor and then Cymbalta/Dulexotine. I took it for about 2 years. Taking this drug felt horrible. When I finally managed to got off of it (with extreme withdrawal symptoms). Immediately after getting off the drug I had these leg pain and tingling in my feet and was was diagnosed with Type 1 insulin dependent diabetes. I was 30 at the time and have no history of Diabetes in my very large extended family. Love to hear from anybody with more to say about this… Something tells me my usage of SSRI and mainly the SNRI is what brought about my T1D diagnosis. Anybody else with similar story? What are your thoughts about this? Thanks",1,9,1
"Cymbalta","GH","March 5, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Wonderful medication. If your ready to get off then  tapper slowly and then get off medication. After I got off I smoked medical marijuana and it helped with the zaps and feeling sick -  the withdrawals only last a bit.  Hang in there.",10,38,1
"Cymbalta","Las789","February 28, 2020","-","I was on this medication over ten years ago. It took a month for the fog to lift once I had started it. But then I started to be paranoid reading about the cymbalta withdrawals on the internet. So I panicked went off it. I always start at the lowest dose possible and stay on it a month before increasing to the next to avoid being sick. And it’s the same thing when you want to get off these meds to avoid withdrawals. You go off as slow as possible. And I want to mention that these meds are metabolized by different enzymes in our body that we all have different levels of because of our DNA. So one person might need a lower dose of cymbalta than another because they metabolize it faster than others. The goal isn’t to get to the highest dose but the dose that works with your metabolism. Ten years later and I have Fibromyalgia  too now so my new doctor decided to put me on cymbalta. I started at 20mg today and will stay with that dose for at least a month before I see if I need to go up. Remember Go Slow!",9,24,1
"Cymbalta","L.p.","February 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started taking Cymbalta 30mg 9 weeks ago under my primary doctor's recommendation. I had severe anxiety and insomnia and very serious depression. I slept all day and had no motivation and couldn't shake it off no matter what I did. I have tried Prozac 50mg for depression and expressed I didn't like that it made me eat all the time (which lead to 50lb weight gain) and no libido. So she recommended this. I feel very numb (but not high) as if I have no more conscience. I also have a slow reaction time to everything. People will speak to me and I don't realize until they repeat my name over 3 times. I also cannot sleep still even with all types of otc sleep medications. I take Cymbalta in the morning so it has no effect on my sleep. I am going to keep taking this medication as suggested but make a follow up appointment. Should there by any secret to make this drug less numbing I will add another review.",7,19,1
"Cymbalta","JB","February 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Wonderful/best antidepressant on the market considering I’ve tried...Paxil, Prozac, celexa horrible!! Non worked and serious adverse starting effects! I’m on Cymbalta for depression and hydroxyzine for anxiety...Do Not Ever let a Doc put you on Klonopin WARNING ?? I’ve learned from that the hard way...so what I have now is so much better..I wake up enjoying life and I feel there is hope beyond the dark..",10,44,1

"Cymbalta","Legs","February 20, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been on Cymbalta for a couple of years now and at first it worked really well.  It has pretty much stopped working for me now. I suffer from chronic pain and depression so life is a lot of fun. I went off Cymbalta one time and the side effects when you go off of it are really bad. You get like lightning bolts in your head. Plus you get really disoriented. Now I'm afraid to go off of them again. I wish I could just stop taking meds all together but I'm afraid of what I would do.",5,18,1
"Cymbalta","LJ","February 18, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","The depression &amp; anxiety was unbelievable before I took meds.   The doc put me on the lowest dose of prozac which did not work and actually made it worse. So  then I was put on Cymbalta, here it is less than two weeks and I can feel little by little everyday my symptoms lesson. Now my depression &amp; anxiety hasn’t disappeared so to speak but it’s easier to cope and maintain. I've had zero luck with SSRI in the past, my body adjusts better with SNRI’s ...there is a blood test you can request to see what works well with your chemistry so they don’t use you as a test puppet..Cymbalta is amazing and I would definitely recommend it!",10,27,1

"Cymbalta","FunnyBone","February 8, 2020","-","I just want to share my positive experience with Cymbalta, since there are so many negative reviews out here. Before this drug, I was on Celexa, then Lexapro...for depression, anxiety disorder and panic attacks. The SSRIs left me feeling flat inside and there were days I couldn't even get out of bed. Cymbalta has changed my life. I have no depression at the moment and have much more energy. I'm more social and have started working out again. In the first few weeks, I had minor side effects - fatigue, brain fog, headaches and nausea. They went away after a few weeks. Glad I stuck it out.",8,61,1
"Cymbalta","K&amp;55","February 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have anxious depression and I have been taking this drug about one month. I had started at 30mg for a week and then switched to 60mg until now. The first days were horrible when I had been sleeping about 12 hours per day had the feeling  nausea, but finally after few days everything was fine. Anxiety is totally gone and I don't feel exhausted from my mood. I feel more powerful and my mood is much better but in any case ok I am not happy. I also, sleep very good. I will stick on this medicine. I recommend to follow doctors prescriptions.",9,16,1
"Cymbalta","Smack","January 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Horrible medication. I had been on it for about a month when I tragically lost my best friend. I couldn’t mourn, I had no emotion. It wasn’t like I didn’t care, it was like I couldn’t care. If making you numb to life and everything around you is the goal of Cymbalta, they knocked it out of the ballpark",1,27,1
"Cymbalta","kitkat","January 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I turned to this drug at my very lowest. Suicidal thoughts and constant lethargy became daily reminders of how depressed I really was. I realized I’d either find a solution or my life would be at risk. The solution was Cymbalta. After 6ish weeks, I began to enjoy activities again and felt very motivated to carry out tasks. My social anxiety now is nearly nonexistent. I’m not happy every day, but the darkness that used to envelope me has subsided and I can say that I see the light at the end of the tunnel (before the drug I couldn’t imagine my life a year in advance because I didn’t know if I’d make it there). My sex drive did suffer a little, but not very much. I will continue to take this drug as long as it continues to help me. Overall, although the withdrawal symptoms may be terrible in the future, Cymbalta truly saved my life and has been worth every penny. Give it time to work and don’t let the negative reviews scare you away if you really need the help.",9,57,1
"Cymbalta","Danni","January 19, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Cymbalta is the worse medication ever your nausea will get worse you start to feel completely weak and most of all it makes you  go into a deeper depression. Do not by all means take this drug",1,26,1

"Cymbalta","Thumb","December 6, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","First off the generics don’t work for me. I have to get them from Canada and they are still very expensive. I am so forgetful and it is getting worse. I really don’t know what to do but when I miss a dose I have terrible dreams. I only take 30 mg. I wish I didn’t have to take them as I pay so much for them.",5,16,1

"Cymbalta","spanishq","December 3, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on Cymbalta 120 mg for 10 weeks. It's been a life saver. I tried venlafaxine before with no relief. In the past, paroxetine worked so good on me, but my doc thought it was necessary to make drug holidays on it, so it became, with time, non effective on me. Also escitalopram with bad results and Anafranil (guess is nortriptyline) with bad results. Also taking Lyrica for the anxiety, Lorazepam 15 mg/day and mirtazapine 45 mg at night. With time, I know I will be able to take off some of this meds, like the high Lorazepam dosage, but I won't be comfortable with taking off Duloxetine, I won't pass through depression again if I know there is something keeps me calm, functional and happy. No sexual disfunction, I'm single and I don't care if I can't get an erection (in fact I can) or weight gain (I weight 5 or 6 more mg than before) but honestly, who cares about this, or dry mouth, if the med keeps working. God bless the inventors of Duloxetine (Cymbalta)!",10,21,1

Put me on Cymbalta and for me, it's a flaming nightmare. I'm on 90 mg and even though it seems to help a bit, I now know that's a lie. The chilling nightmares that have me awake and soaking wet, unable to catch my breath properly. I don't recommend this stuff, if you want to have a good nights sleep ever again.",1,29,1

"Cymbalta","Amy","November 14, 2019","-","Awful. Was given the lowest dosage cymbalta for work related stress/mild depression.  Made me have night sweats and insomnia.

"Cymbalta","Smile 23","October 23, 2019","-","Cymbalta is good for depression and did help my relative for 10 years 60 mg every day but my relative wanted to be free from using anti depressants and so stopped it slowly  reducing the dose  which later worked and they felt relieved  but got the worst depression and even attempted suicide. l am here to warn every one not to try to stop taking cymbalta if it is working for you just stick to it  - the withdraw was a horror and after withdrawing it gave them 2 months of peace and third month a very bad depression that they have never experienced came back that they attempted suicide . They then had to put my relative to bed rest for 7 months every medication failed to work so they were switched back on cymbalta but it was also not helping even after increasing the dose so finally at the dose of 90mg it didn't help until Aripiprazole was added that's when it helped with depression but caused bad anxiety which we stopped with 0.5g lorazepam morning  and  evening",9,41,2

"Cymbalta","karysue","October 15, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I took this drug for 4 years for depression. It was not very effective and I tried to slowly go off of it even slower than my doctors recommended schedule. I took four months. A week after stopping I felt like I descended into the darkest place, I became cold and clammy, I screamed and felt so hopeless.  Then I suffered daily panic attacks, my husband had to be at my side 24/7 for 7 weeks - SO FAR.  I do not know how long this will last. No one can say. The Cymbalta withdrawal center says it lasts for 2 months. My recommendation is NEVER GO ON CYMBALTA. My physician friend told me to get off of Cymbalta is as painful as getting off of heroin. NO JOKE.",0,40,2
"Cymbalta","Trekk","September 30, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","The most important thing I want to share here is that it is the most addictive substance I have ever taken (And I have tried at least 100 different drugs.) It's not addictive because of the benefits it gives. It's addictive as anything because when you forget to take a pill - all the hell break loose.  I highly do not recommend this to anyone. If you consider taking it - DO NOT! UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. Better be sick from your illness then get another illness because of this medicine. Do some online research about  CYMBALTA HURTS WORSE",1,49,2
"Cymbalta","Nandor","September 29, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Absolutely terrible. I was prescribed 20mg Cymbalta to replace Prozac, which didn’t help my depression at all. The first few weeks there were no changes, so we increased it to 30mg, then 60mg. I lost the ability to feel emotions at all. I was numb. I couldn’t make myself eat. I lost 5% of my weight. I had started self harming just to feel something and felt suicidal. For some reason, I told myself to go to the doc one last time. It’s recommended that Cymbalta should be tapered off slowly, but there’s almost no way to do that 60mg to 30mg as it  a big jump and the capsules shouldn’t be opened. The doc said I should quit cold turkey since I was in such a dark place. The withdrawal was torture. I couldn’t leave the house for two weeks because of vertigo,  brain zaps , headaches, and confusion. I’m on Wellbutrin now and it’s a hundred times better in my experience.",1,40,2

I was on 60mg for about 5 years and now on 90mg 5 years. I tried to come off it so for one month I took 60mg last February. The symptoms were unbearable. I felt bee stings everywhere and I literally mean everywhere. My legs were in soo much pain my whole body felt like it was shaking inside. I had flushing a fever non stop itching. The list goes on. It definitely served a wonderful purpose when I started, I just kinda feel cheated they didn’t tell me I have to stay on for the rest of my life.",8,60,2
"Cymbalta","Carolyn","September 16, 2019","-","I have Summer SAD (seasonal affective disorder)  (yes it's a thing). My insomnia was made worse by this drug  Cymbalta but it did take away my anxiety and I may have lost some pounds on it. After a couple weeks I dropped down to 20 mg every other day so I could sleep better. It was toward the end of summer and I started to wean myself off. I haven't had one in 2 or 3 weeks and I am still getting dizzy here and there. Did not experience zaps like others but I have to agree the withdrawal is quite lengthy for someone taking only 20 mg and for a very short time. Withdrawal symptoms included dizziness and daytime sleepiness - I only took this drug for maybe 6 weeks, and not every day.",6,26,2

I got shaky hands, chills, fevers, itchy skin &amp;, two weeks on, prickles, like nettles or poison ivy all over my body. I felt like I had restless leg syndrome through my whole body. Nausea was persistent. I also found I was unable to manage any social interactions. I have still not gone back to work. The depression came back hard. Aug 6, 9th, Aug 19, &amp; Aug 29 were all awful days. I didn't think I was going to make it. The hopelessness &amp; despair were the worst I have EVER experienced. July 29-Sept 12.

They did nothing for me. I felt like I was taking a placebo. After a bad breakup about a year ago I experienced severe depression and my anxiety was through the roof. I went to go see a doctor and told him SSRI’s don't work for me! He said just give Cymbalta a shot, if it doesn’t work in a month or two we will try something different. I thought what do I have to lose? Within a couple weeks I could tell a difference in my mood. I was shocked because like I said, these drugs have never worked for me. Within a month I felt totally back to my normal self. No more depression and my anxiety has been drastically reduced! This drug has been awesome for me.",9,62,2
"Cymbalta","Rocky","September 1, 2019","-","It might be a good thing that I have all-over body pain with my type of depression.  Good in that if I don't take my medicine I feel bad.  So I can't be a patient who refuses to take their meds.  Cymbalta IS MY GO-TO antidepressant.  I won't let my doctor take it from me......hahaha.  I used to get a griping type pain in my right side when my depression worsened.  My doc couldn't explain it. I think it was just one of the symptoms of body pain caused by my depression.  I remember seeing the TV commercials for Cymbalta  for fibromyalgia. That's when I became familiar with the name.  I can't tell if I have any side effects from Cymbalta.

"Cymbalta","Kimberly","August 31, 2019","-","This medication has really helped with my depression and anxiety. I was skeptical due to negative reviews, but I’m glad I tried it and have stuck with it. I’ve been on it for about 4 months and it took about 6 weeks for me to really feel the effects. My thoughts of suicide have reduced greatly, and my overall anxiety has gotten better too. I have had these issues most of my adult life as a result  of a traumatic childhood. I have previously tried Prozac but it makes me gain too much weight. Effexor helped in the past, but I can’t stand the brain zaps when you miss a dose. With Cymbalta, I’m more calm, less anxious, less depressed, and I don’t get as irritated with my husband and young daughter as I used to. I’m going to stick with it for as long as it’s working. The main side effects for me have been constipation and zero sex drive. But I’d rather deal with those things than think about suicide and cry every day.",8,45,2

Unlike most of the reviews I’ve read and experiences I’ve heard Cymbalta actually gives me insomnia for the first week or two that I take it , it also suppresses my appetite a lot and makes my mind feel fuzzy. But Cymbalta also works immensely for me in terms of my depression which has been severe since childhood making it feel manageable. The withdrawals do suck , I get insomnia again, restless legs and brain zaps. If you can stay on this medication consistently or long term it’s a good option for depression/ anxiety.

I also have myofasial pain syndrome, fibromyalgia, bursitis, sciatica, SI joint Dysfunction, osteoarthritis in my left knee/right hip. Cymbalta pulled me out of the horrible depressive spell but it really calmed my fibro and myofasial pain. Like 85% better. Worse in the summer so I'm experiencing it still helping me but a pain flare-up trying to fight thru. I'm susceptible to migraines, cymbalta has not given me headaches. When I first took it it really knocked me out made me feel gross so I learned to only take it at night and it really helps me sleep. Only two bad things that have happened is - forgetting to take it the next day I'm pretty miserable and feel slightly out of it. The other is stay sitting up after taking it to make sure it does not dissolve in my esophagus or I get severe pain and diahrrea. I'm on 60mg since February and I still feel good.

My wife and I started to argue and she would call me a walking zombie with no feelings at all. I didn't want to have sexual relations with her and that took a toll on our marriage.

I had no adverse effects coming off of it except that my anxiety &amp; depression worsened. This year was the first time I’ve had my dosage increased since starting the med.

I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder (dual diagnosed) This condition has been with me for many years (runs in the family i.e. mother was severely depressed). Cymbalta 120mg per day snapped me out of it. Under doctor's orders I discontinued current SSRI at the time and started right up with Cymbalta 120mg/day. Within 7-10 days I was out of my depressed state. It has to be the norepinephrine aspect that made the difference.",10,143,11

My libido decreased and climax is harder to achieve (but more intense). The medicine felt strange (out-of-body) at first but I got used to that.

My depression had gotten so bad that I was willing to try everything. I was having emotional breakdowns at work, having horrible thoughts, bad dreams, and was withdrawn from everything. My depression is a brain imbalance, rather than caused by other things. Only being about two weeks on Cymbalta, I can already notice a difference. I'm more peppy, I don't think bad thoughts nearly as much, much more patience, haven't cried since I've been put on the medicine. I was a little jittery at first.",7,87,13

The only other negative about this medicine is getting off it. Do not, under any circumstances stop taking it immediately. It swings you into an extreme depression.

So I'm going off Wellbutrin, which had worked great in the past. Cymbalta really is the best anti-depressent that I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  The only reasons I ever went off it in the past was the bloated feeling I felt and weight gain.  So I am committing to eating better (watch calorie intake and get off the carbs) and excercising.

I feel happier, have more energy, more positive. The only side effects I have had is insomnia, jaw clenching and hot flashes, which are not constant, and mostly tolerable compared to the side effects I had before when on other medicines.

My initial result was hot sweats, but no other help.  I missed a day while I was on 60 mg and had vertigo and an electric twinging in my brain that actually made my vision jerk.

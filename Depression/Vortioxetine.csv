"Vortioxetine","Lee1209","June 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Trintellix (vortioxetine):</b>			 I started Trintellix 2 months ago for anxiety/depression. I've been on Wellbutrin which helps my mood &amp; can counteract some sexual side effects so I’ve stayed on it but it hasn’t really helped my anxiety. I’ve been on Zoloft, lexapro (horrible experience) and cymbalta, all had side effects I ultimately found unlivable.  Honestly, starting trintellix was rough but if you can manage, stick with it! I had pretty bad nauseousness but only threw up once within the first few days of starting, &amp; I started super slow &amp; low. No other side effects and this is the first med that has not affected my sexual function.  My anxiety is lessened and I feel hopeful. The daily nausea has gone away although I’ve noticed I’m more prone to motion/car sickness but my doctor gave me zofran for that.  So far this Wellbutrin/trintellix combo is the best I’ve found for me. P.S. go through their website to get your Rx card to help with costs it helped my price tremendously",0,7,1

I was told take it with food in the morning to stop nausea. First day my stomach was upset but no vomiting. Today I took it after I ate and within a hour or so I vomited so badly my throat is completely sore. Is this normal? This is such an expensive drug, even with insurance I paid almost $200. I don’t want to discontinue the use just yet but I am not sure I can handle the nausea and vomiting. Anyone else having these same issues?",0,5,1

My former doc prescribed me trintillex. he swore it was a super clean med with out side effects. it's been 2+ years taking it (max 20mg) &amp; I had no positive effects. Don't let your doc tell you it won't/rarely causes weight gain. IT DOES, especially if you're a female. It will continue the longer on it/dose increased. Also, awful GI problems- bad nausea or bad constipation. Also only makes anxiety worse especially if you take in the AM- take in PM you can't sleep ^_^  I would stay away from this drug DEFINITELY if you have anxiety, sensitive stomach, prone to weight gain from meds. I'm done off this in 4 days! can't wait",0,15,1
"Vortioxetine","Andy","May 17, 2020","-","I’m taking this for anxiety and obsessive thoughts which started after a large bender the previous year after lads trip to Ibiza. The first 4-8 weeks were pretty bad and it didn’t seem to work, in fact my anxiety and thoughts felt much worse.  I found it hard to sleep but didn’t have any other side affects. After 8-10 weeks and increasing the dose to 15mg things started to work. Sleep massively improved and coupled with meditation my anxiety is practically non existent. It can flare up though after a drinking lots of beers. The obsessive/taboo thoughts are still there but more manageable.  Overall my experience has been good. Very little to no side affects which others have reported. I lead a normal life - just got to sometimes remind myself I’m 35 not 25 (3 glasses of wine a week and not 3 bottles is now the rule). Hope this helps - just be patient with it as it took almost 10 weeks for it to work for me.",9,3,1

I like to think I'm very strong minded when it comes to taking antidepressants. But when I started on brintillex literally within 5 minutes of me taking it I was getting sick, for the first time ever I was getting a side effect from a pill. I thought maybe I was just sick the first time I took it but every single time I did within 5 minutes I would be getting sick. This happened in the car we would have to pull over this happened in work. I'm not one to give up on something so I said I was going to keep going and push through I stayed on it for over  3 months and it didn't get much better! Such a waste of time and money it cost me a bomb for a box of it I think 70 euro as I don't have a medical card and there was no generic version! Worst antidepressant ever.",0,11,1

I don’t know if increasing to 10 mg would help or not.  I do know that so many people on this forum don’t seem to give the meds enough time to work and I always feel worse before I feel better.  I’m wondering if this pandemic we are in is increasing my anxiety and I just have to deal with it.  I don’t feel as sad,  unmotivated, and tired all the time, since I’ve been on trintellix.

The condition I have is absolutely horrible. I was previously on zoloft for over 10 years 100mg. It starts to flatten out so my doctor also gave me Wellbutrin 150mg in 2016/2017. In May 2019 my PGAD condition occurred (reasons are still unknown). I was then told to go off zoloft due to it's sexual side effects and try something else. My doctor gave me Trintellix 10mg. At first it worked okay. I felt super nauseous for a while. Then later almost every night I waa throwing up an hour after taking Trintellix. I took Trintellix for 8 months with zero relief of the vomiting. I have to take domperidone before my trintellix so I don't puke. My condition sort of got better now it is terrible. I also have anxiety and panic attacks nearly every day and cry very easily. It just isn't the pill for me. It was used for my anxiety and did not work.",0,24,1

I am happier than I have ever been and so impressed that Trintellex was able to get me through the incredibly difficult last two months, e.g changed jobs, had a project with an impossible deadline, the holidays, etc.  I'm on 10mg daily.  Side effect-wise  I have some sexual dysfunction (loss of libido, difficult to achieve orgasm) but right now it seems worth it to feel this good.  I've also lost weight. A new wrinkle as of 2 weeks ago is a tinnitus.  I only notice it when its totally quiet which hasn't made sleeping the best so I take Trazadone to help with that which works great.  After two months, I'm still feeling great on the Trintellex but the side effects aren't dissipating and I'm wondering how long I will be able to deal with them.  Definitely not forever.

It was affecting my eyes, my blood sugar levels (type 2 diabetic), intense hunger pains, and in general made my body feel unwell. I tapered down for a couple months and then stopped. But everything has a price. Currently I'm suffering from severe discontinuation symptoms. Body shocks, numbness, weakness, twitches, skin sensitivity, etc. It's going on 6 weeks since symptoms appeared but they are lessening. It's been tough. I haven't been able to work, play much with my son, or spend much time with my wife. Overall I'm glad I took Trintellix.

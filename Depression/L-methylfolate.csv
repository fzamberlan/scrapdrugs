I have the double mthfr mutation. It did nothing for me and is prohibitively expensive. I’m not sure if I buy into their mthfr serotonin theory, but it seems to work for some. For me, I would get these weird sensations in my hands and feet, almost like they were heavier or more sensitive, and I felt like my sleep was less restful (even I got 8 hours consistently) because I was always tired. It made me feel off as well, but I assume that is just depression medication in general.",0,1,1
"L-methylfolate","Finally","February 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Hi I've suffered from depression since my early thirties . At that was when it was diagnosed. I've tried most of the antidepressants and for short periods of time they certainly have assisted me come out of some pretty dark places. Now in to my 50s I'm tired of taking the medication and do not feel that it has been assisting me. Recently I have tried Nurofolin and I can't believe the difference. I weaned myself off the antidepressants and then began taking your folin within two weeks my mood was lighter and my anxiety reduced considerably. I have now been taking it for well over 3 months. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has work done the work and now just wants something to keep their mood balanced. Of course this is not for everyone but in my experience I am so grateful to finally find something that truly helps without the chemical side affects.",10,4,1
"L-methylfolate","Ravioli","January 5, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","After 40 years of SSRIs &amp; counseling failing, I felt hopeless.  Many days were torture.  I tired too easily, felt sad, hopeless, unmotivated &amp; anxious more than I should have most of my life.  Finally I took l methyl folate at 15 mg and got an immediate rash.  Then, based on internet info, I took 1mg.  I noticed an immediate reduction in sadness, improved energy and interest...but by day 4 I had an unbelievable panic attack with dry heaving and misery.  Thankfully, I knew to take niacin and, within the hour, I was normal.  This happened 4 times and I had had enough.  But I was beyond despair, so I tried it again at between 0.25 and 0.5 mg and added a small amount of niacin (and will add methyl b12 because I think the problem occurred because I’m building up nitrous oxide).  This tiny amount, taken carefully, has completely made me normal.  NOTHING else did.  I have the MTHFR gene mutation, severe form.  To me, it’s like a miracle for which I waited too long.",10,17,1

My depression responded poorly to nearly every antidepressant on the market for 10+ yrs. Turns out I'm homozygous for the MTHFR mutation. Started taking 1mg L-methyfolate pills by Superior Source,  increasing every few days to hit the recommended 15mg/day for depression. Had an immediate improvement in energy, and my other meds, like Allegra, started working better. I also tried OptiFolate 7.5mg, MD Life 5mg, and NOW 5mg. My depression symptoms and skin-picking came back on each of those. My psych finally wrote me a prescription and now I'm on 15mg pills made by Breckenridge. They work as well for me as Opti Folate: not very well at all. YMMV  (your mileage may vary), I've seen reviews on Amazon where people responded much better to Opti Folate than Superior Source.

The antidepressants cause me to feel suicidal. About a year ago, doctor gave me Deplin. I take it when I need to and it works. Just 3 days ago, I felt suicidal and was hearing the voices inside my head. Day 3 of Deplin and I feel better again. I only use Deplin and nothing else. Yes it's tough managing the other symptoms by myself but they're nothing next to my depressive episodes. All I can say is that L-methylfolate is helping me. It is the only thing that has ever helped.

We all know people with depression are pros at the  fake smile  but my smile is from the heart.

I have switched to one of those.  I use 15mg tablets and cut them in half, so a bottle lasts for 180 days. This is much cheaper than Deplin (the generic costs about 40 cents a day.

It serves as an add on to my anti depressant meds. It hasn't been a magical booster to improve my severe, resistant depression as well as my horrible anxiety. However, over a year's time, Deplin has helped me feel just enough better to justify its cost. A very subtle improvement that is difficult to describe. I'm glad that I stuck with it; not at all noticeable until at least 9 or 10 months. And that time frame ( for subtle change ) isn't acceptable if you are miserable. But, I was improving just enough with my other meds to allow me to continue taking Deplin--just in case it began making a difference ....whenever? Plus, my dr. told me it was good for my overall health,  regardless if it touched the depression. This made it easier for me to continue taking it despite feeling no benefit for a long time.",0,29,2

"L-methylfolate","Pay less","April 21, 2017","-","As mentioned in other reviews Deplin is designed to augment other medications to increase their efficacy. All Deplin is is L-methylfolate packaged as a Prescription medication by Drug manufacturers to make money on a supplement that is readily available for much less cost. If you are paying more than $30/month check out other brands It sells L-Methylfolate 15 mg 30 capsules for $30. They also have 7.5 mg capsules. Methylpro is not a generic Deplin. Methylpro is L-methylfolate. Deplin is L-Methylfolate. No difference. Naturopaths and savvy Doctors (not the medication only white coats) have been using L-methylfolate years and years before it was packaged as an expensive prescription drug.

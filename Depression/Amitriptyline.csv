"Amitriptyline","Adama","May 15, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I tried many different medications for depression and anxiety.  SSRIs, Benzos were both epic fails and caused more problems than they were worth.  When I moved and got a new doctor he reviewed all the past failure drugs and proposed amatriptline.  A drug first approved in the early 1960s.  After the very 1st  dose of 10mg was a stunning improvement.  I highly recommend those who are treatment resistance or have realized the MTHFR gene exists in them.  For those who do not methylate folate.  For me amitriptline was god send since suffering from Xanax ot benzo withdrawl.  Amitriptline is $5 bucks copay not sure of retail but it will be cheap.",10,8,1

My main side effects are weight gain (went from 115-135lbs in a year), nighttime eating, and an occasional dry mouth. Be warned. This medication makes you very hungry!",9,2,1

"Amitriptyline","JEB 38M","January 20, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","6 WEEKS  Give this medicine a chance, I did not see any results week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4, then began to notice the fog lift week 5. I  had tried paxil ,cymbalta,effexor,wellbutrin,celexa,citalopram,escitalopram,buspirone,trintellix,viibryd (worked for 1month),abilify (worked for 1 month). Some are duplicates (generic). Even tried suboxone it worked for almost 1 year. Amitryptyline sedating effects don't exactly wear off.  They completely go away and its almost like the sedative effects slowly transform into energy and wellbeing which I think is good because while its sedating it allows your body to rest and repair itself while catching up on sleep. Don't hold me to this and it might just be an aberrant few good days.  I will follow up with some more info in a few weeks.

Pristiq was OK, but I still had some awful PMS symptoms (cramps, anxiety and migraines).  Trintellix didn't work.  Amitryptaline is my saving grace! Don't be afraid of it.

I don’t know how to say that loud enough and with enough emphasis and drama because, just 12 days ago, quite honestly death was looking like a better option than living the tiny dark life that I was existing within. My only fear is that  this will be short lived.  Overall I’m sleeping so much better, I’m thinking better, I’m not anxious or paranoid about the plethora of things I am accustomed to being anxious about.

"Amitriptyline","Iryna","July 10, 2019","-","Would start after chatting about amitriptyline  with my friend after chatting we decided to do activism amitriptyline should be prescribed much more often!.  Once I started on amitriptyline (for depression) I even started working part-time. From the very beginning I felt that it works much better for my major recurrent depressive  disorder. First of all - much more energy comparing to  escitalopram (esc.) that I had taken before. My friend also tried amitriptyline after being on esc. , and found out that even in small dosage like 50 mg daily is more efficient than esc. Important! It decreased my sexual energy - I needed it so desperately because had nobody to have sex with! I received amitriptyline 5 years later than I started needing it! Particularly because of side effects that make doctors prescribe it only in cases when newer antidepressants don't work enough. So anyway if you have long and strong depression -  I highly recommend trying it.  Side effects - dry mouth (later disappears), all the way - higher appetite. But it may be worth it! Cheap!",10,28,1

As I continued with the medication, the side effects and symptoms disappeared and my depression still continued to improve as well as my sleep.

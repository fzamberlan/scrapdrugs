"Surmontil","Louise Howard","October 18, 2007","-","I take Surmontil for serious depression and anxiety.  Before taking Surmontil, I took paxil and a host of other medications.  None worked and my doctor suggested that I find another psychiatrist.  I did and was fortunated to find a doctor who understood my condition and prescribed Surmontil for me.  It saved my life.  However, it is no longer manufactured in the U.S. so I have to get it from a Canadian pharmacy, which is ok by me because there is nothing else that can help me.",0,68,1

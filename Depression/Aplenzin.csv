"Aplenzin","BB","May 3, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on Wellbutrin for years my doctor tried me on aplenzia 522mg I felt better and there was hope then my insurance quit  paying for it. What sense does it make, to make a drug that no one can afford and give out samples and make people get false hope they things will get better. I feel this is just cruel !! But it is  a good  drug  if some how afford  it !! It was possible that  I could concentrate didn't  gain weight! Felt almost normal!! Thanks for letting me down",9,11,1
"Aplenzin","Leocap","January 26, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","My  psychiatrist gave me some samples to try. Days one and two were not bad I started feeling kind of dizzy and almost like I was in a bubble on day three. Day four was horrible I was very dizzy my joints started aching so badly I could hardly walk down stairs. I was so unbelievably cranky and mean, it was  horrible! By 6 PM that night my face was bright red and I felt like I was drunk! I didn’t take one this morning and I’ve been having stomach cramps and diarrhea since this afternoon, hopefully it doesn’t take too long for this to get out of my system!",1,9,1
"Aplenzin","Chuck","June 24, 2018","-","I survived for 20 years on many medications. Wellbutrin was hideous. On it, I couldn't sit up, walk, think...like I was dying of terminal flu. Effexor helped, but not much. Soon I gave up; my wife suggested magnet therapy. (Insurance said we had to prove that medicine didn't work for 2 years.) Time's up, but I finally got an Aplenzin sample. I knew of no similarity between Aplenzin and Wellbutrin. Hours after taking a pill (522) my face lightened as if a dark veil had been lifted, my spirits soared, I had focus and motivation to accomplish tasks, and I wasn't raging as much. I haven't felt this way for 20 years...no, forever! No comparison...I have no idea about its efficacy long-term, but I rated Aplenzin 9, because of side effects (which I gladly embrace). Our chemistries are all different; different drugs effect everyone in a personal way. All I can say is...I finally found the medicine I've needed for 66 years!",9,27,1
"Aplenzin","MDDSurvivor","September 11, 2013","-","I'd been on Wellbutrin/Wellbutrin SR for over 15 years and it worked great until about a year ago when I started feeling I'd built up a tolerance to it.  Seeing that Aplenzin was basically the same, but in hydrobromide form instead of hydrochloride, I figured it would trick my body into reacting to it as a new medicine without losing the benefits. With the blessing of my psych doc, I switched and it appears to have worked.  I'd give 10 stars, except for the high cost.",9,26,1
"Aplenzin","Sandy79","March 30, 2010","-","Aplenzin unfortunately did not work for me.  I have panic disorder which then sent me into a horrible state of depression.  My psychiatrist first prescribed me Wellbutrin SR which I was taking twice a day.  After about 3 months I started having moments where I was actually happy to be alive.  At my next appointment, my psychiatrist asked if I would be intereseted in trying Aplenzin because it only needs to be taken once a day.  I started off on 348 mg for three months.  This was not working so he switched me to 522 mg.  Two months later it is still not working.  I spoke to my pharmacist who told me that I have been patient enough and if it is going to work  it would have done so by now.",2,23,1
"Aplenzin","Not Crazy","February 1, 2010","-","Celexa and Zoloft made me feel detached from life so I wanted to try Aplenzin. At first I thought it was the wonder drug. I felt ALIVE, full of hope and energy. I cared about my future and could get things done. I was so happy, possibly euphoric. I stood up for myself and felt in control. I thought I had found the answer. That was on the low, intro. dose (174?). Then I went up to middle, recommended dose (348?). All that good stuff disappeared. Can't sleep, feel like I'm on the verge of panic attacks. Found myself watching the colors on TV and the colors owned me. Never had this experience before. Mood swings and deeper depression now. Want that good feeling back. Have call in to doctor about going back to lower dose.",5,29,1
"Aplenzin","dmrcoast","November 12, 2009","-","This was not for me. I took this with Lexapro and my depression worsened and also I experienced severe mood swings.  Became very angry and easy to fly off the handle. Thoughts of suicide as were more frequent.  I stopped taking it after 5 weeks and noticed an almost immediate improvement in my behavior and how I felt.",2,15,1
"Aplenzin","Anonymous","October 28, 2009","-","I switched from Wellbutrin to Aplenzin 3 months ago. I had a good sex life before on Wellbutrin. I switched my medication instead of increasing the dose of Wellbutrin. Now that I am on Aplenzin I feel numb. I had this same feeling when on Zoloft.",5,21,1
"Aplenzin","UNEEK1","September 23, 2009","-","I was on Wellbutrin HCL SR 200mg for 10mos and I noticed a significant improvement with my depression. However, I started to crave cocaine because my Dopamine levels are low.  My Doctor switched me to Aplenzin 348mg ER.  I have been on it for 2 weeks now and I have noticed a great improvement with my concentration, ability to get projects completed and not focusing on cocaine cravings. It has helped with my emotional eating too.  I actually feel like I am a normal 40 yr old married mother of 2 boys. I feel like cleaning my house instead of sitting on the couch in front of the T.V. all day.  The only minimal side effect I have is increased sweating.  I am hoping that this will subside after a few months of taking this medication.",10,34,1
"Aplenzin","That Girl","May 2, 2009","-","I have bipolar disorder/panic attacks/anxiety/major depression - needless to say there's a lot on my plate. However, for my depression Aplenzin has been working very well. I don't get so frustrated over the extremely simple things like not finding a sock (as a personal example). Overall I think Aplenzin is good. APLENZIN gives me energy and helps my personal outlook. I take 522mg a day. I'm pleased with this medication, I do though take into consideration that I've only been on it for about a week so I am on alert for any changes. Aplenzin works great for my depression so far.",10,54,1

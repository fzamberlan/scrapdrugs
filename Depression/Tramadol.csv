"Tramadol","Sober alcoholic","May 22, 2020","-","Took first dose 2 years ago. Was 1 year sober (alcohol) and took unprescribed for pain. Took 2 weeks to go 300mg/day. 6 months later at 800mg/day; had 2 seizures. After I maintained at 600mg/day for 8 months. Was happy, energetic, and productive. Wanted out, not willing to give up benefits. Then pandemic came/shut down my source. Self-tapered, now at 100mg/day, can’t taper further without physical withdrawal. Altered mental state to point of suicidal ideations during taper. Works as antidepressant, very addicting. Wish had never taken. I read these forums when I first started experimenting and thought I could manage it. I was wrong. I guess it treats everyone a little differently, but if this post could persuade one person to get out of it before it’s too late then I have my purpose for posting. Please be very careful with this drug, I am still in so much psychological pain unlike anything I’ve experienced since getting sober.",1,16,1
"Tramadol","stephen55","March 2, 2020","-","The SNRI metabolite for Tramadol yields most of the anti-depressant action. More mental and emotional energy.  Personally, I haven't noticed any addictive quality at all. I have used other hard pain relievers (Oxycontin and Fentanyl) in the past, so I know my Tramadol is not like those. Also I have used Tramadol for 8 years at 400 mg/day; I have experienced NO tolerance-building; I don't have to increase the dose. Psychiatric usefulness definitive.",10,38,1
"Tramadol","CatMom","February 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I have suffered from depression for years, and also have PTSD. Last year my depression became much, much worse. I was in tears most of the day, no positivity with anything and to the point where I was contemplating suicide. I had tried so many medications and CBT , nothing worked. I was given these tramadol for my depression and they worked within hours. I could not believe that one little tablet could have such a drastic effect. I now take 50mg in the morning and 50mg at night, I have never taken more. I have no side effects and can honestly say that Tramadol saved my life. I know that it does and will not work this way for everyone, this is just my experience with them and I am truly grateful.",10,38,1
"Tramadol","Quando62","February 17, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I've been prescribed EVERY anti-depressant known. I have what is knows as Treatment Resistant Depression. I stumbled across Tramadol 7 years ago and WOW, after an hour, energy, happy, feel like I can do things again after 20 years. Haven't had to increase the dosage after 7 years. This medicine has saved my life. After I take it, my wife says my eyes aren't blood shot, my mood is like it was 30 years ago, and now working full time and building a business up on the side! It's helping my Psoratic Arthritis which I had to increase to 300mg's a day since being diagnosed in 2017",10,231,1
"Tramadol","elandem","February 6, 2020","-","The tramadol helped my depression for a while. I took it on at off (50 mg per day) with various antidepressants.  I would feel effects about 2 hours in, but they would fade quickly - and they never fully took away symptoms.  I then started taking 2 (50mg) per day - one before getting up to help morning mood and then one later in the day.  This was not effective at all.  I've now been on the 2X per day dose for a month and am tapering down to 1 per day for a week, then will go to 1/2 per day for a week and stop.  I'm going to try pregabalin as my depression has some anxiety and that might help?",3,4,1

"Tramadol","Jame583","January 13, 2020","-","I actually found  tramadol worked for depression while being treated for pain in back. Noticed how great I began to feel. No depression and actually felt like myself for the first time in years. So I actually had a long talk with my psychiatrist and after showing him several articles from various sources, the NEJM for one and much more and telling him of my experience why using it for pain and how it uplifted me he finally agreed to it on a trial bases. I haven’t looked back since. Now I still take my other depression meds. The tramadol is in additional drug. Yes it is addictive and no I don’t care. Your body will start showing signs of tolerance and you made need to adjust your dosage over time. I recommend starting on the lowest dosage that works for this reason. Do not abuse it because it makes you feel high or buzzed. This will increase the quickness in tolerance and you will eventually run in to the ceiling on daily maximum dosage",9,29,1
"Tramadol","gettingBetter","January 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I was prescribed Tramadol 50mg a day for chronic pain and found it also cleared my foggy head and low energy.  This has been a life changer for me. I've gone from sitting looking at a pile of work thinking, I just don't have the energy to do this, to wow getting everything done and more.  I was not depressed, my foggy head and low energy is from chronic inflammation, arthritis, insomnia and autoimmune disorder.

"Tramadol","Becky28","December 23, 2019","-","I am a single mother of 3 boys one who has autism and some days we're soooo hard that I was only just coping. I had anxiety and depression. I was prescribed me some tramadol for a headache I had and let's just say in about 40 mins I went from feeling anxious, stressed and angry to happy, energetic and playing with my children. Complete life changer for me for the better. My quality of life improved along with my families as now they have a mother who is happy, patient and calm. I've been on tramadol for about 7 years with no complications. At most I have gone up to on bad days was 800mg but now I taper down or have a couple of days break so my tolerance does not build, because obviously like other pills the withdrawal is awful. But so worth it for me",10,35,1
"Tramadol","Rachael","December 19, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Tramadol is the only thing that has ever worked for my depression.   However, because of the Opioid crisis every time I tell anyone, including doctors, this fact, they treat me like I am drug addicted.   Several have gotten snotty with me and insisted they have never heard of such a thing.  Because of this, finding a doctor who will listen is next to impossible.  I had one, a very good one, but I had to move away.  This drug significantly improves my life.  When it wears off in the evenings, I sink back into suicidal depression.  I have one refill left and then I am back to life debilitating misery.",9,24,1

"Tramadol","Alex","December 3, 2019","-","I've had a mesh implant. It's not getting any better as far as the pain.  I've been diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I've been on all types of medication , but they had caused way too many side effects. Tiredness was something that I can't deal with, and tramadol doesn't make me feel like that. I've been taking tramadol for pain, but it has totally made my life better. My mood is up, I'm no longer depressed, and I only take 150mg a day. Virtually no side effects. I truly wish that tramadol could be prescribed for my mental issues. It has kept me from relapsing. I've been clean and sober for three years now. I haven't had any cravings since I've started taking tramadol.",10,36,1
"Tramadol","Anonymous","November 22, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I just wanted to do a follow up , from a previous post about Tram for pain. So let me just say Tram is a depression, anxiety killer. Point blank. There is not another drug like it. The chemical make up is so unique because,  yes it does help with pain. But it will absolutely give you a new lease on life if you are depressed. But please, please use with caution, never ever take more than prescribed. Because let me tell you, If you ever have to quit the Tram. The withdrawals are a living hell. And that is putting it mild. There are two classes of people I would recommend Tram too. One with severe depression, that other SSRI did not work. And those who plan on staying on Tram for life. And not conning off. If you ever have to go without for couple days. You will see what I mean. Great drug, lifesaver in some cases. But proceed with caution. Please",10,46,1
"Tramadol","flowerflower","November 20, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I suffer from depression and I know for a fact Tramadol helps it.  I get tramadol once a month for my back pain.  It helps a little for the back pain but helps my depression enormously.  The only bad thing about it though is like with all opioids you build  up a tolerance, and even for depression, you need more.  I always run out and my depression always comes back until it's filled again.  No other pysch med that I have taken works as well.  I also know that even though it takes my depression away that it's too good of a happy mood.  So I'm sure it is probably making me high.  You know they first made Tramadol for depression.  But they noticed exactly what happens to me when I take it.  So no I do not think it would make a good depression med, due to the fact people would and do abuse it.",0,9,1
"Tramadol","Gradience","November 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I see a lot of reviews on here saying how much of a wonder drug tramadol is for depression, and I just want to mention why doctors don't want to prescribe it is because it is VERY addictive. Tramadol is an opioid, so taking it daily is not a great idea, even if its a small dose like 50mg. However, it is very effective and works amazingly well for social anxiety, and for me the social effects last even longer than the actual time that the drug is in effect. That said, just watch how often you take it to prevent addiction.",8,17,1
"Tramadol","Ralphy E.","November 13, 2019","-","This medication is simply perfect.  I take one 50 MG dose in the am. One 50 MG dose in the afternoon. If necessary, one 50 mg in the evening.  Zero drowsiness. Zero side effects. I’m the happiest human on earth. Cures 100% of anxiety and depression. It even helps with pain related issues too. But for depression and anxiety, it is amazing. It also deters you from wanting other drugs (whether it’s marijuana, alcohol, or anything else) because you naturally don’t want it because you don’t feel anxiety or depression. You are genuinely happy and clear headed.  If you want to get high, take something else. If you genuinely want to be happy all the time with no anxiety or depression and want to socialize, this is 10X better than anything else.

"Tramadol","Makpaz","November 1, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I'm upgrading from 9 to 10. For some reason there is no randomized research comparing tramadol with mainstream antidepressants. Do not be surprised as the realization that tramadol outdoes all the other antidepressants combined has a huge price tag. Tramadol doesn't pay for your psychiatrist to go to Maui and to advertise its near miraculous affect on depression and anxiety within the medical field is sacrilegious. Nevertheless it's an amazing drug. My friend takes 50mg daily without ever needing to raise the dose. Note that different genetics have different liver enzymes. People of Middle Eastern and Southern European descent seem to better process tramadol. Less lucky are people of northern Europeans descent and Orientals descent. Or so I observed.",10,20,1
"Tramadol","El Chico De Miami","October 30, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Suffered from depression since I was a teen. Nothing helped. In winter and autumn I feel so bad everyday that I literally want to suicide. One of those gloomy, dark and cold days I was prescribed tramadol for another pain that I had. I felt so happy, like I've never been before. It's really a miracle drug.  In my experience, taking just 100mg a day makes my mood a lot better, without getting me high, 250mg  is too big a dose.  It is not addictive at all, I mean physically, psychologically it kind of is. No withdrawal symptoms at all. Can easily take it then take a break for a week and start again. BUT, couldn't accept the fact that I would never take it again. Just can't. Give it 10/10. Don't recommend doing it everyday but it is good for depression",10,19,1

While at my London office, I stopped by a pharmacy for some Advil for a headache.  The Pharmacist pointed to an over-the-counter medication.

"Tramadol","El","July 29, 2019","-","After 45 years of having depression, I have realized that tramadol takes away the symptoms of depression better than antidepressants.  I consider myself an expert in depression because I’ve survived this long and I’m still alive.  No psychologist or psychiatrist in the world that knows this illness better than a person who’s had it all their lives.  Reading the comments here it’s very sad to me that the organisation has so little concern for the welfare of the people who need this drug that they have demonized it and put it in the same category as heroin.  If you are taking 50 mg a day of tramadol you can quit immediately. It is such a low dose that it’s sold in many countries (like Mexico) over the counter.  Not only is our healthcare too expensive, we can’t even get treated with drugs that work. I hope doctors in America start to listen to their patients and read the testimonies here instead of what is dictated as real. It’s infuriating.",10,70,2

Well , it can be, but be cautious because it will be the hardest drug you have ever tried to quit. From 8 years of experience. I take 400 mg a day. I have 2 bad vertebrae , stenosis, degenerative disc. Nerve compression .  Tram was prescribed for the pain. But it took only a week for me to know something was different After years of Anxiety, depression. Suicidal thoughts. It all ended by the end of that week. There is no other medicine made to do what Tram does. None. Effexor comes the closest. But Tram blows it out of the water. Tram never makes you have that high spacey feeling, just a relief from the panic, depressed. I don’t ever plan on quitting. Like I said earlier, you better plan on being on Tram for the long haul, because their is no going back, once you start. Your depression and Anxiety, pain will be unbearable.

The DR will not prescribe this to me since I am on addiction treatment, he won't even prescribe me an anti-depressant that matches Tramadols. I have made my situation even worse now since I got to experience Tramadol's anti-depressant magic knowing I cant get that medication prescribed.

Chasing toddlers around and doing house work can be aggravating at times. I've found tramadol to help with quite a few things. Mood, Motivation, pain, depression. I no longer take valium and effexor for my anxiety and depression because tramadol helps everything in my case! It's a wonder pill for me. I usually take 50mg when I get up, 1 later on in the day, then 1 at night. Sometimes I might take 2 in the morning and then 1 later that evening. But regardless tramadol makes me feel normal and able to do my everyday duties without being in a slump. Shame it's a narcotic now bc doctors are hesitant to prescribe and you don't get refills so u have to go every month to your doctor to get it. Hope this helps someone in pain and or depression as I've found it to be of help in both areas!!!",10,65,2

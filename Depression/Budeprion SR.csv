"Budeprion SR","Mo","March 11, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’ve been taking Bupropion SR for about 6 weeks now. A little over two weeks ago I started to itch at night. It would itch pretty much everywhere, including my scalp. When I scratched, my skin would welt, turn red, and get hot. It wasn’t until a few minutes ago that I realized it was the bupropion. Dumb, Ik. I did some research and found a connection between the bupropion and Urticaria. Apparently, this medicine is know you cause dermatological issues. I wish I had realized it was my meds sooner instead of thinking it was an allergy to my laundry supplies. Also, noticed I am getting a side effect of joint pain, called arthralgia. I’ve noticed for the past couple weeks joint stiffness, pain, and swelling- which the doc brushed off as a meniscus injury. I’m sad to have to stop the bupropion bc it was really helping my anxiety and depression- especially the anger.",8,7,1
"Budeprion SR","Kase","August 29, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My wife and I were going through a really rough patch and I just couldn't seem to get out from under the looming depression of inevitable divorce. My Dr. started me on 150 mg in the morning and a week later 300 mg in the morning. I got panicky with 300 mg dose and had chest pain and palpitations. He dropped me down to 150 mg in the morning. After about 4 week, I really started to see a mood improvement. My wife dropped the divorce bomb on me and it didn't even hurt. It literally bounced right off me and kept on with my life. Two weeks after that, the guy I was told not to worry about moved in with her. I literally didn't feel sad or depressed. It bounced right off me. I wished them well in their future endeavors. This medicine is exactly what I needed! It is life changing! My life is continuing to improve daily! I've entered the dating world again and it seems to be easier than ever. I don't fear rejection anymore.  It has given me strength and courage I never knew I had.",10,24,1

"Budeprion SR","Sarah Blasingame","June 4, 2017","-","I was on citalopram 20mg and due to a death in the family, I was unable to get my prescription renewed before I ran out. So two months passed before I got to my doctor and I had done extensive research before making the decision to switch to Bupropion. I have been on it for 4 days now, and I definitely have the get-up-and-go that I never had before. I am beginning to enjoy the things I used to again.  HOWEVER, I am a serious coffee and sweet tea addict and for the first 3 days of use I had diarrhea and according to other people's reviews, it's actually quite common. I also was concerned because falling asleep is just a little more difficult but I still get 8 hours. I guess I'm still adjusting to the idea of being normal and stable.",8,11,1
"Budeprion SR","Seans Mom","November 9, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have been wanting to write this for a few months because I have seen so many questions about side effects/interactions.  I started taking SR on a friday, I was fine, Saturday - fine, Sunday - fine, on Monday I went to work, by lunch, all He** broke loose, the dreaded diarrhea. All day Monday was horrible, Tuesday, same thing, by Wednesday I could not take it anymore, so I started researching and found that Wellbutrin (Budeprion)  interacts with caffeine. So Wednesday- no coffee,  no diarrhea, Thursday- no coffee, no diarrhea.  So I have only drank decaf coffee since, and have had no diarrhea.",6,8,1
"Budeprion SR","FrankSpeek","November 8, 2016","-","Wellbutrin works well for the type of depression recently crippling me.  That 'I Don't Want to Get Out of Bed and Face Yet Another Horrible Day -- I Just Want to Give Up' type of depression. Wellbutrin, for me, erases those bad feelings and does so very quickly. Within 4 hours of my first dose my confidence came surging back. The rapidity of action is due to the unique way it works; it isn't the typical antidepressant. Wellbutrin has side effects, but none harsh enough to stop me from taking it regular. The side effects I experience is (a.) a tense feeling (physically), and (b.) kind of a 'chemical taste' in my mouth. But, there's no blurred vision, no zombie feeling and no terribly dry mouth. The payoff is worth it.",8,8,1
"Budeprion SR","Wilma4969","March 13, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was changed from Wellbutrin XL 150, to Bupropion HCL SR. I have gained weight since the change. I feel better, but don't need the extra weight. Is this drug causing it?",9,8,1

"Budeprion SR","Anonymous","November 18, 2010","-","I have been trying both 300mg and 150 mg. Daily doses in combination with 20 mg Lexapro for several years now.  I was not doing well on Lexapro alone, still too mopey and negative.  I am finally doing much better and feel strong enough to let go of the Lexapro and try Budeprion alone.  After just a few days I feel totally different and much better.  It is very energizing, I feel positive and am getting a lot done.  My libido is coming back and the sexual side effects from the Lexapro are gone too.  300mg per day may be too high for me, I feel almost manic.  I may try (with my psychiatrist's support) to stay on 150mg but so far this medicine alone is working extremely well for me.",9,31,1

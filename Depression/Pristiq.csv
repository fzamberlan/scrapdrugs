"Pristiq","gsodak","May 4, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Pristiq has benefits, BUT, be aware of serious long term use side effects.  They are real.  This is a powerful drug that affects many body systems.  Don't ignore your side effects.",4,6,1
"Pristiq","Sayman","April 29, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Pristiq save my life. It is the only option I left in the world, it reduces my head pressure and anxiety. Just  try it  and see how you go. I am 100 mg on it.",10,10,1
"Pristiq","Billy","March 10, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Pristiq 50 mg is the ONLY medication which has worked for my depression. Good sleep Good appetite Upbeat, consistently good mood. I have tried everything else and nothing Worked OR I had bad experiences. This is my fifth year on Pristiq. If you’re without hope, ask your doctor. It’s been a lifesaver for me.",9,38,1
"Pristiq","Johney","February 23, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I found this drug to be extremely helpful. I haven't felt this good in years.  I started with 25mg and it took approximately 4 weeks to start noticing the benefits. My therapist recommended I take the medication after having a serious panic attack that left me anxious and worried for my own personal safety. Never been that low before.  Now about 5 weeks in, I'm feeling great and we decided to up my dosage to 50mg. I've had zero side effects as of yet.  My advice to anyone on here who's curious about the drug to give it a try. And give the medicine time. It takes time to fully take effect. Like I said, it was weeks on end for me. Felt like an eternity. I'm more optimistic, motivated to accomplish goals, less anxiety, etc.  Medications are like shoes; not every shoe is well suited for every single person on Earth. The same could be said with regard to medication.  Take care all. Feel better.",10,55,1
"Pristiq","mtl222","February 21, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on Pristiq for 1 month and a half.  The first week felt weird : I had headaches, anxiety, couldn't eat, difficulty to sleep.  Then the physical side effect went away and I started to feel better but it was very subtle and slow but steady change.  After 1 month and a half I can say that I feel a lot better. I have more energy, more sense of control on my life.  One thing that stays is that I have to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated.  I have skipped a dose once and it wasn't bad, I didn't cry or felt horrible.",9,38,1
"Pristiq","Kay","February 19, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Had a DNA test to recommend what type of anti-depressant I should be taking....I had been on Venlafaxine for years after refusing others. Pristiq was recommended by this test for me to take. I did notice a number of positive changes taking Pristiq......Generic Desvenlafax.  I am more alert, Have somewhat more interest in life. No longer think about dying. It doesn't control my anxiety so therefore I take  a mild dose of klonopin when needed. It did not give me energy but helps making me get up and around. I take 50 mg's a day. I do sleep 10 to 12 hours a day....sometimes not waking up during that time but I know that's the depression.I do take Amitriptyline for pain from Spinal Disk Degeneration pain.",8,23,1
"Pristiq","MAB","February 17, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Initially Pristiq kept me on an even keel. Then it didn’t seem to make a difference. I don’t feel interested in anything.  I have gained 20 lbs in six months. I told my doctor and she said to stop taking it. Easier said than done. It made me extremely sick. Headache and nervousness were unbearable",3,18,1
"Pristiq","rbc123","February 16, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I never write reviews on ANYTHING online but after being precribed Pristiq for anxiety and reading multiple negative reviews I thought I'd write about my positive experiencing with this medication.  I am 31 years old and have been experiencing moderate to severe anxiety my entire life. Last summer I began taking this medication and I won't lie... the first 4 weeks were rough. Decreased appetite, increased anxiety and just very spaced out. Saying this, once you get passed the 4-6 week adjustment period this medication is LIFE CHANGING. And yes I know that this medication does not help everyone who takes it but I encourage people to tough through the adjustment period. I honestly wish I knew about this medication earlier. And yes there are still lows you will feel, this is life. And this is not a magic pill... but completely takes the edge off. I wake up feeling great most days, I have increased motivation, little to no self doubt, increased appetite, increased sex drive, etc.... the list goes on.",10,63,1
"Pristiq","F*ckpristiq","February 14, 2020","-","I would not wish upon my worst enemy the hell I went through with this drug.  My doctor at the time suggested this antidepressant to help maintain my growth &amp; help my energy... this was the first year it existed and of course was expensive because there wasn’t a generic brand, it ruined my life. Everything in the small print happened to me. I slept on average 2 hours on my bathroom or kitchen floor because I felt suffocated in my bed. Everything irritated me physically. All I did was clean as if I was trying to get rid of something so toxic (pristiq) that my life depended on it (it did..) I lost a lot of my hair/eyebrows and I was going crazy, literally. Eventually I got off it, which was like detoxing from a hard drug, such as heroin or meth. I was on it for 6 months- I have been off it for many years, but I still struggle with the reality of what it took away from my life- so many years trying to pick up the pieces of the horrific reality I lived while on Pristiq.",1,18,1
"Pristiq","Niko","February 13, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I'm on Pristiq 50 for 9 months.  I have had no negative side effects except brain drain when missing  a dose. I like it so much that I want to try a higher dose.  I've been depressed for decades.  I've tried most other SSRIs antidepressants with mixed results.  Pristiq is for me the best of the lot.  I'm very surprised to read so many reports of adverse reactions.",9,25,1
"Pristiq","Crazybananas","February 12, 2020","-","So I had to share my experience because I’ve read so many reviews of so many different drugs.  I was on every possible SSRI from primary care dr.  The side effects were horrible.  I mean HORRIBLE.  Zoloft, lexapro, celexa, Prozac.....you name it I tried it.  Finally got smart and went to a psychiatrist at the advice of my therapist.  Hallelujah!  He put me on pristiq and within days I felt better.  It’s been two weeks now and he just doubled my dose.  I take 25 mg at 7 pm and noticed by the next day around 2 I was getting anxious, clenching my teeth, etc.  so he has upped it to 50mg.  He also gave me Ativan for when my anxiety is at full tilt.  I’ve had no side effects.  I just want to give people hope.  You can’t go by the reviews because we all react differently to medicine, but don’t give up.  See the right professional.  I also did the mouth swab thing to see what medicines might be a good fit.  With the $$$$$.  Good luck to whoever is reading this and stay strong",9,50,1
"Pristiq","MKate","February 8, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Pristiq has been a life changer for me. I know it gets a lot of bad reviews on here, because I looked at them before I started it lol. But it may be the med that works for you. I have not felt this good in years. My energy is good, I laugh way more now, I am able to recognize and replace old negative thoughts with more positive ones. I have gained a few lbs but it’s nothing compared to living in depression. I am so thankful for this medication after trying 3 other meds that weren’t very helpful. I hope the good effects continue. Only side effects are sweating and sometimes I’ll wake up in the night and be unable to fall back asleep for an hour or two.",9,22,1

It’s sad how you want people to check your Terms and  Policy just to have their comments heard.",2,12,1
"Pristiq","JCU78","January 21, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I just started Pristiq and slowly tapering off Paxil due to ED. It will probably take several weeks to work. I take other meds to treat panic attacks and hypomania so I am not worried. Depression is bad along with stress and it is important to find the right medication. If you are constipated then I recommend taking a stool softener- not laxative for constipation along with plenty of fiber. All meds take time to work, but only you and doctor can make that decision and no one else.",8,11,1
"Pristiq","Seaweed","January 19, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I did genetic testing and it showed I should use Pristiq for depression. For the first month it was wonderful. Then I stopped sleeping, would just start to drift off and then suddenly wide awake.  I am trying to wean off been crying non-stop for weeks. Out of control anger and screaming. Suicidal thoughts are constant.  This has never been me. I have always been joyful, optimistic and outgoing. I’m now locked inside afraid of going out in public due to erratic behavior. I am beginning to think the genetic testing is done by the makers of this drug",1,18,1
"Pristiq","Ratus","January 17, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I had tried a few other AD's Zoloft, sertraline being two I remember over the last 14 years. I put on 12kg but attribute this to the amount of beer I was consuming. My G.P suggested Pristiq which I have had good results from for the past three years. After two years of heartache following the collapse of my marriage my drug and alcohol nurse suggested that I should be on Citalopram.  My G.P agreed to try it and after taking only 10 mg I felt fantastic.  Little did I know I was under prescribed. I was mildly manic for 6 to 8 weeks and then the depression / anxiety and rumination set in. I went up to 20 then 30mg but couldn't concentrate at work and felt drowsy constantly.  I went back to pristiq 75mg and after one week feel much better. I keep a diary of daily moods etc.",0,12,1
"Pristiq","Hans1","January 14, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","At 2 months on Pristiq. I switched to Pristiq from Lexapro because of slow weight gain and occasional brain fog on Lexapro.  Gene testing indicated Pristiq should work for me and it has made my mood stable but has totally blunted any emotion I feel, good or bad. My doctor has added 2mg of Abilify to boost the effectiveness but I haven't noticed any difference from that yet. I can easily live with this compared to depression but I don't feel my pre-depression normal at all.",7,10,1
"Pristiq","TMc","January 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I tried many meds over the years that would only work for a short time. Started Pristiq one year ago. Iv'e stayed on 25mg which is normally a step-in dose. It works great for me. I was very tired the first three days but since that time I haven't had any side effects at all. This med has given me my life back!",10,23,1
"Pristiq","Kitcat","December 22, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I almost lost my life because of this drug and Effexor. I was on effexor for a year and couldn’t sleep, had massive anxiety everyday and felt groggy and tired everyday. Got switched to pristiq and had extremely real suicidal thoughts that I’ve never had before. Had to wean myself off of it because doctors didn’t understand why I was still not able to sleep all night (would wake up every 2 hours), why my anxiety was constantly spiking and why I was so suicidal. My cognitive thinking made sense but my physical reactions did not. I weaned myself off and my anxiety attacks mostly stopped, I was not depressed anymore and I could sleep again a full 8 hours (which helps with cognitive function a lot).  The brain zaps were awful and my agitation was sky high while going off.  Now I’m on a high CBD tincture and find it works better than any anti-depressant I’ve used in the past.",1,19,1
"Pristiq","Beth","December 13, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","It was awful!  I cried non stop, couldn't sleep, loss of appetite, I felt out of control so my Dr. increased the dose to 100 mg and OMG!  I finally had to tell him to get me off of it - weaned off of it over a month and was  so scared of possible withdrawal issues - absolutely none.  Getting off was the best thing ever.  It was definitely not for me.",1,11,1
"Pristiq","Ronnie","December 11, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on Zoloft for a little over 2 years, doses increased towards the end of taking it. However, I finally started seeing a real psychiatrist, and I asked him about SNRIs like Effexor and Pristiq, and he ended up putting me on the latter. Within 3 weeks of taking the meds, I started cutting myself and had to check into mental hospital. For the next 3 months, traumatic events began to happen, causing flashbacks that are still happening as I’m tapering off the medication, and even the slightest criticism at work hurt my feelings or made me sensitive and I started making threats to kill myself when someone hurt my feelings. Thankfully, my doctor has switched me to Cymbalta which I hope really works. Pristiq was a BIG waste of time and money, a huge hassle, and I would not recommend it to anyone fighting depression.",2,14,1
"Pristiq","Gratefulmeduser","November 25, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","After 20+ years on SSRIs, I have a new lease on life with only 25mg pf Pristiq. I’m alert, in a positive mood, and  have lots of energy. This has lasted for 6+ months. This drug is so much better for me than were any of the SSRIs (I tried probably all of them). The only reason I give 9 stars is because of low appetite and constipation side effects.",9,40,1
"Pristiq","Feeling better","November 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Ive been on Pristiq for over a year now. I understand it doesn't work for everyone, but I fully think it saved my life. I used to be between so many medications, and I fully think that this will be the one for me. The biggest thing it helped me do was remove the obsessive side of my depression and removing the CONSTANT invasive terrible thoughts. The side effects have just been kind of annoying. You definitely HAVE to be on top of taking it though. That's what keeps it from getting a 10/10 in my opinion. Overall its definitely worth trying.",8,36,1
"Pristiq","Rumi","November 21, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started Pristiq 3 months back with 50 my dosage for mild depression. On the first 2-3 days I felt a bit light headedness. After two weeks my dosage was increased to 100 mg and since then I have continued the same dosage. For me, this medication has worked very well so far. Obviously the medication will not fix everything by itself, you'll have to gradually push yourself to work on your lifestyle changes too for the medication to work properly like taking a healthy diet. I also made it a point to never skip the dosage and I missed it only two days up until now. Thankfully it has worked very well for my depressive and PTSD episodes.",10,23,1
"Pristiq","Sue","November 16, 2019","-","I started having withdrawal symptoms an hour before my next dose it made me sick and scared. My mood changed I became  angry yelling at everyone. I got physically sick also. My health went down hill. My doctor finally took me off after being diagnosed with Serotonin Toxicity Syndrome! When being weened off I felt suicidal and  was in such a dark place. I was put in a psych hospital and then one month later I had the first of 8 strokes! I will never be the same.!",1,21,1
"Pristiq","v","November 15, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","It's not for everyone, but for those of us who it works for, it works wonders. I can vouch for this drug for those of us who have been let down by SSRIs, it's worth a shot. The side effects are more annoying than dangerous ( I would get really bad night sweats for the first 3 months), but it's a pain in the ass if you forget to take a dose even once because you'll get brain zaps from withdrawal because you fully metabolize it within +/- 22 hours. I'm giving it a 9/10 because the brain zaps are really annoying but other than that I honestly believe it saved my life. For a lot of the people who can't tolerate this drug, it's largely due to metabolism and genetics, so don't be too disappointed if it fails. It has a MUCH shorter metabolizing time than most antidepressants, so it's kind of weird.",9,21,2
"Pristiq","21855000906992","November 8, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I don’t like to rate this prescription because it does wonders for other people it just didn’t for me. I was on Pristiq 50 mg for five weeks. I was experiencing all of the side effects probably because I’m very sensitive to drugs. I ended up going  to a psychiatrist which I didn’t want to at first but my family talk me into it and now I am I ever glad I did. He helped me wean off of the Pristiq by prescribing mirtazapine 7.5 mg, Because I’ve been having some problems with insomnia and it has also picked up my mood. I’m very sensitive to drugs. He also told me how to go about weaning off the Pristiq in a safe way with very few side effects. The psychiatrist also said that if somewhere down the road I would like to stop taking them that that would be no problem as well. My advice give it a try and see If it works for you if not see a specialist who knows how to take care of you the right way. Have a great day and all the best.",3,23,2

I have stopped craving food and endless carbs 4. I’m losing the 30 pounds I gained on it over 6 months.  This medication made me weak. I was into working out: cardio and weight lifting. I found it harder and harder to lift my weights, losing ground. I lost motivation to workout. I craved carbs terribly! It gave me TMD. Basically it just wasn’t good for me.",1,19,2

"Pristiq","Nass","October 14, 2019","-","Hi I was put on Pristiq for major anxiety and depression two years ago. Initially I was put on Lexapro for 5 years I stopped it for a year as it was so horrible to my body and made me gain 40kgs. I was put on VALDOXAN which awful, did nothing to me except gave me severe anger issues. So two years back my mother is law recommended Pristiq to me which I spoke to my GP and  went straight on to it. Yes it changed my life to be the best. Lost some weight on it and gave me energy boost however now after two years and a bit on it I decided to go natural as I do not want my body to be fully dependent on medicines. I stopped it about a month ago and I am having the worst nightmares in my life. Severely tired body aches, insomnia, shortness of birth. It is POISONOUS medicine. I am having horrible time and my wife is about to have a baby and I do not know what to do or how long does it take for the withdrawal side effects will stop. Am DONE. Plus I put on 7kgs the past month since I stopped it.",4,21,2
"Pristiq","Room","October 10, 2019","-","Be aware of the time-release factor in Pristiq.  It is almost impossible to step-down or taper off, and the side affects of missing a dose can be debilitating.  I took Pristiq for over 8 years after a very traumatic experience.  It helped me cope at that point in time.  As a teacher, I tried almost every summer to get off the drug, and finally was successful by stretching the 24 hours until I could get myself down to 25mg one summer, and then repeating the next summer to get off entirely.  After 8 years of depression in an emotion-numbing state, I was able to rejoin the world with joy and enthusiasm.   I learned that my 'anxiety-attacks' at night were caused by A-Fib!  I was mis-diagnosed and suffered for 8 years, using a drug that did not alleviate the anxiety-attacks!  Be careful, and insist that all physical factors are explored before taking anti-depressant, and avoid Pristiq like the plague.  It is designed to keep you on it.",1,17,2

This was awesome until I missed 2 days in a row (bad I know but unintentional) and boy did my brain let me know there was something seriously wrong! Brain Shocks! You who know these will agree. Since then I've been told it's too dangerous to stop taking them. This isn't a cure, it a 'Patch'  as my doctor referred to it as, and in my personal experience it's a bad one.

"Pristiq","Poe","September 4, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I took Pristiq for 7yrs (daily). In 2012, my life was raining down (stress and worry) and I was knocked off my feet. My  Fight or Flight  mode was in overdrive (insomnia, rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure).  My Dr. put me on 50mg of Pristiq and 10mg of Bystolic. I was able to weather the storm, but I become an emotionless robot. I never laughed, cried or displayed any emotion, and I had always been the life of the party. Pristiq also kept my BP at the hypertension level, in spite of taking a beta-blocker (Bystolic). My sex life had also vanished. I was also craving naps (often).  A week ago, I decided to stop Pristiq (cold-turkey). I was in a good place, and after 7yrs, of Pristiq side effects, I felt it was time to find my emotions again... I’m in day #7 of quitting Pristiq. I feel good. No brain zaps, insomnia, dizziness, nausea etc. Hoping that my current journey back to the Land of Emotions continues to go well. I still take a (daily) beta-blocker (Bystolic).",5,26,2

There several medications I've tried and worked only to lead to weight gain. My doctor told me about Pristiq and figured I'd give it a try. I found that this medication works really well the only big down fall is the side effect of missing a dose and trying to come off of it. The severe dizzy light headlines is unreal. Almost fills like you have a bad hangover. I started taking something else while trying to get off of Pristiq, it has been a huge challenge. I'm so tired of feeling like garbage, so I do not recommend this medication for anything. Not only did have this bad side effect but I've had a problem with my jaw as well. For the last three months or so my jaw has been so tense that I can barely open my mouth to eat anything. When my dentist learned what I was on she told me this is a side effect of this medication as well. I've even gained over 30lbs while taking this. Please beware before you take this",3,24,2

I know suicidal ideation can come with taking these, but for me it’s greatly decreased that. I tried taking zoloft before this and it didn’t do anything.

I've started the wellbutrin and I am taking the Pristiq in conjunction to taper it off SLOWLY due to the brain zap side effects, taking the pristiq only every other day the first week. I still have the brain zaps after not using Pristiq for a day, but it's manageable. Second week now so I'm skipping the pristiq 2 days in a row for a week while on Wellbutrin. Getting off the pristiq is not easy, even after only taking it for 2 months, so if it works for you, make sure you stay on it and don't skip days. Nasty side effects. Like I said, it didn't so much for me after 2 months.",4,15,2

I'm new to taking medication for depression, tried to deal with it on my own but apparently 29 was the year I decided my thoughts weren't normal. The side effects at the beginning were intense. The most prominent being stiffness in back and jaw, yawning, dry mouth, strange depth perception issues with vision, feeling jittery/shakey, heavy chest/anxious feeling, and what I will call vaginal numbness. Most of these symptoms subsided after the first three weeks, thank god because the heavy chest feeling was not pleasant at all! Others come and go, ie. Dry mouth, jaw stiffness, and vaginal  numbness. I occasionally feel very happy and excited and other times quite robotic. However, my thoughts have changed completely since I started this medication and I think I really needed it to realize that those thoughts weren't normal and to see how much better life can be without them.",8,31,2

When it comes to mental health drugs - I am thoroughly convinced the pharma companies and psychiatrists...and now even GP's - are all working together to push this garbage on desperate people.

I still get brain zaps and dizziness, even if I miss my dose by 2 hours.  It's horrid.  I'm trying to wean off all mood medications. Apprehensive because of how I feel after only a day.

"Pristiq","Whosewho","June 26, 2019","-","I've been taking pristiq along with doing cognitive behavioral therapy. I've come leaps and bounds since then and a lot of that is due to therapy. However, I wouldn't have been able to initially manage the day to day responsibility and stresses without Pristiq as well. Rated a 7 because it's side effects are severe at the beginning (wide eyes, hyper alert, increased anxiety). As well, you need to be very very consistent to take it at the same time every day/or as it is prescribed for you.  I really do not enjoy the side effects, it not as they effect my vision,  concentration,  out of world like feeling, and it can be visually obvious to other ppl which just increases my anxiety. My goal is  to come up with a healthy plan to go off the medication as I have now developed tools to manage my PTSD,  anxiety and depression, but I find I get distracted by the symptoms of the medication during times of stress as they seem to peak almost like they're working in overdrive.",7,14,3

I had taken a test called youscript to identify how my body metabolizes drugs. The results showed that I don't effectively metabolize most antidepressants. A psychiatrist said that my only solid option was Pristiq. It was much better than the other ones. It didn't effect my sleep, or cause daytime sleepiness, or make me feel emotionally numb like the other meds but it was harder to orgasm. The cost is $55-60 for 30 tablets of 50mg (BC, Canada). Fair Pharmacare doesn't cover it, so my student healthcare did not cover the cost either. I've been relying on my mother's healthcare plan. In Canada they don't have 25mg so I went from 50mg to nothing and it was rough the first week but I was off school &amp; had no work so it was manageable.

The first few days taking it I had kind of migraine like symptoms, very tired, but just plan accordingly and know that will all most likely pass. Any antidepressant will have an adjustment period.

I looked at the most  common side effects of Pristiq and they were increased or excessive sweating, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, sleep problems (insomnia), loss of appetite, tightness in your jaw , but for me I was so flat emotionally and ended up gaining 40 pounds, it was like my body never got the cue that I wasn't hungry.  I also dealt with constipation, sexual side effects and general blahs. Going OFF the medication was the hardest part. I GAINED 10 pounds in a month going off it, I was in a ver dark place, VERY emotional and rage-y, and had severe dizziness for like two months.

This happened about 4 times and I sat over the toilet bowl waiting for it to come out. Nothing eventuated. THEN, the jaw clenching?????

This phase went away after about 3-4 days, and everything was back to normal. After about 2 weeks, I wanted to get out and do things everyday, which was positive, but the depression was still there for the most part.  Over the next 4 weeks, I SLOWLY noticed the depression disappearing, and now I find it is  alot easier to brush off negative thoughts that depression brings. Just remember, this drug takes along time to work. Stay patient with it. My Doc also told me that EACH SSRI/SNRI has about a 66% success rate. So, if pristiq doesnt work for you, try another SSRI and it will have a 66% hit rate.

Mentally, I felt like myself again 100% but I developed giant hives all over and had severe itchy palms/feet. She switched me to Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) and the allergic reaction went away. I am normal again! I have a few mild side effects (dizzy, a bit tired, etc) but to feel normal is worth it. I tried a few beers once in a while but panic attacks seems to creep up in the days after. So I've stopped drinking alcohol. I'm still amazed at how horrible panic attacks and GAD are!",9,20,4

Without question it has changed my life incredibly.   I waited 47 years to have the courage to take an antidepressant and wish with all my heart I had met this medication in my 20's.   I started on 50mg but after a two months reluctantly headed up to 100 ... my reservations were for nothing ... this medication has worked beautifully for me.   I did have side effects in the first few weeks, beating heart, very thirsty and slight headaches, but they passed quickly and I have been amazed by its strength ever since.   I have had some serious life crises to deal with in the past three years ... and often feared the medication would not be able to 'hold' me ... it always has.   I have an amazing therapist who I saw for the first two years but no longer need that support, the medication is enough.    I used to have so many concerns about taking any such medications - was frequently turned away from them by what I'd read as horror stories online ... I wanted to let you know ... it's not for all of us ... some of us do have great reviews ... maybe not enough of us drop back to pass them on because we got busy with our new lives where wellness is the new normal.   I never worry about coming off them, I don't care if I have to take them forever ... as long as I feel this good I'm not ending my relationship with them ...",10,74,7

You couldn't have a panic attack if you tried to talk yourself into it.  2. You will not gain weight (I lost weight originally and then went back to normal after 6 months). 3. Your depression will subside - though there is a BUT with that. The not great: 1. It is really hard to get off of, brain zaps, no step down options. 2. You become a bit zombie-like, lost creativity etc. A lot of not caring so much. 3. Sexual side-effects, though they do improve over time. Solid 5/10",5,36,7

It was uncomfortable and annoying. I kept taking it in hopes of it helping my suicidal thoughts, and major anxiety. Now, all antidepressants CAN increase suicidal thoughts. Pristiq definitely increased these bad thoughts. I threw up before work (anxiety) &amp; was always a nervous wreck. I'm off the medicine now. Going back to the doctors to talk about other options.

I was I admit surprised that my GP who I have only known for three years and who hasn’t previously seen me depressed spotted my change in mood before I had had chance to tell him how I was feeling.  I walked out holding a script for a new drug Pristiq and began the medication the following day.  My next appointment to see how I was coping was for last Monday.  One of the side effects of Pristiq is according to the warning sheet my pharmacist gave me was hyper-wakefulness.  Needless to say I had a paradoxical effect I have spent a month falling a sleep during the day.  Later sleeping eight to ten hours at night.  Due to the most awful pharmaceutical hangovers I needed to get up at 6 am in order to be in a fit state to drive by 7.30. My doctor found this interesting but urged me to continue taking the drug as he felt sure it would help my illness saying I needed to be on it for twelve months. However, in the past seven nights things have gone from bad to worse. Every night has been disturbed by the most frightful nightmares. Night sweats and terror on waking from the most vivid of horrors.  On Friday night I lay awake forcing myself to stay awake, I was far too frightened of returning into this new nightmare world to sleep.  My fearful dreams kept me from my bed the following night for several hours I finally went to bed in the early hours I slept fitfully my dreams were again frightening to say the very least luckily I can’t recall them in detail by midmorning.   It was on Saturday that I decided that enough is enough depression is more than sufficient without entering a nocturnal world of fear and torment.   While I was only on Pristiq for five weeks it was five weeks I’m not about to forget any day soon.    When the treatment is worse than the illness it is time to stop; take stock and in my case back away.   I know that I most probably should have spoken to my doctor but it was Easter and I couldn’t see him so I made my own decision. Now only time will tell if my decision was the right one.      But one thing I do know is as a drug Pristiq is not for me.  Even at its loudest a barking  black dog is less scary than a night on Pristiq.",1,40,9

Sleep hasn't been a problem- but I have found that I need to take the meds at the same time in the mornings or I have headaches. So far, so good. Hopefully it will continue long term.

I was extremely happy, with virtually no anxiety.  I am now on week 2, and the anxiety is starting to creep back in and I'm not quite as happy, so I will be discussing increasing my dosage with my doctor.  The loss of interest in food has persisted.

It worked OK but after a while not so much and all I got from it was that zombified what's the point of life anyway feeling.  I switched to Pristiq and it was much better.  It cuts the depression but doesn't give you that blahed out zombie feeling that the SSRIs can do.  I don't have much of the side-effects luckily.  I have noticed it takes longer to ejaculate (but I think my wife sort of likes that part of it- sorry for too much info). Anyway Pristiq is a great medicine.

Over the years my depression has gotten worse - I was having 'breakdowns' more frequently and for longer periods (at least twice a year, and I was out of action for a month or two at a time). I became extremely depressed at the beginning of this year and was suicidal. As a nurse, I am a terrible patient and refused to be admitted. With some negotiation with my GP, I was put on Pristiq 150mg and Mirtazepine 30mg daily. It has taken a few months but I am finally feeling like 'me' again.

During my first 2-3 weeks of taking the medication I was even more tired, had to sleep for at least 3-4 hours after taking the medication, which prompted taking it at night. The BIGGEST DRAW BACK for myself is that Pristiq has made running and physical recovery double in time. I've added almost 1 minute 20 seconds off of my run time additionally it has become extremely difficult to find the motivation for working out.

I can't wait to see the full effect!  By the way - to all the guys out there - I've had NO sexual/libido effects from this.  In fact, no side effects at all.  Just feeling happier than I have in years, calm, energetic, and interested in life again.  Love Pristiq.",10,26,20

I decided to try Pristiq because my doctor mentioned that there were less weight issues. I haven't had any bad side effects except when I forget a dose, uncomfortable brain zaps as the person had mentioned.

I used to get angry with my kids for being naughty, and stay angry for ages, just getting worse and worse. Now I take the time to be a Mum, talking to them and not stressing about the little things they do. As for side effects, I had a little nausea, and irritability (which I still have at times, but I have 4 kids under 4, and my husband works away from home) but overall it's much more pleasant in our house.

"Pristiq","divainpink","September 2, 2008","-","I have been on Pristiq for 12 days. It has helped me tremendously with my depression issues. A few years ago I had tried wellbuterin, lexapro and cymbalta and experienced side effects. I gave up but recently decided it was in my best interested to try something else. Pristiq has completely changed my whole outlook on life. I do have problems sleeping and have dry mouth someitmes but totally worth it.",9,136,29
"Pristiq","Anonymous","August 28, 2008","-","I have been on Pristiq for about 2 months. I've tried probably 10-12 other anti-depressents with lots of side effects that made me want to quit them. I feel better emotionally today. I have no side effects and I am able to complete tasks in a reasonable amount of time, without feeling overwhelmed. I have no anxiety issues and I am finally enjoying my life. I only wish the insurance industry would cover this medication.",10,237,29

"Pristiq","Almost there","August 19, 2008","-","I have been taking Pristiq for 5 days.  This is the first antidepressant I have ever taken.  It is working great, though the first day or two I felt like I was taking diet pills.  My appetite is gone and I have lost 4 pounds in 5 days.  I have felt a good deal of nausea, but have not vomited. I'm always thirsty and have trouble sleeping (which was a problem before Pristiq), but my doctor gave me Xanax to help me fall asleep. I feel better than I did before.  I hope it will work for you too.",8,158,29
"Pristiq","lab_lover","August 16, 2008","-","I have been on Pristiq for four weeks and as others have noted, I have lost weight (20 lbs.) and have feel much better about myself both mentally and physically. I have experienced some unpleasant side effects that could possibly be the Pristiq but could also be caused from a new pain medication I have been trying. Maybe the doctor can decide next week after my checkup.",9,49,29
"Pristiq","bluebayoula","July 24, 2008","-","After a little over two months on Pristiq, I have lost a significant amount of weight - something I really needed to do.  I am taking the recommended dose and I haven't felt this productive in years.",8,360,29

"Rexulti","Lilly","June 9, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I struggled with anxiety and depression for 17 years since age 6.  I tried every other medicine without success.  Finally, with the help of the almighty, I have greatly improved on Rexulti.  A real miracle!!",10,8,1
"Rexulti","Melfell","June 1, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Rexulti has been a MIRACLE for my anxiety/depression. I’ve tried pretty much every antidepressant on the market and had awful side effects with every one. I take lamictal for depression and adding this on top of it, it absolutely changed my life for the better. I have no side effects other than gaining a couple pounds, which I needed",9,5,1
"Rexulti","Anonymous","May 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started on Rexulti at the low dose of 0.5 mg. It was really helping with my break through depression. I have been taking Wellbutrin for about 2 years and I needed a little boost. Well 2 months later and I gained 10 POUNDS. Super disappointed. The medication works, but be ready to be depressed about how much weight you've gained from it. Won't recommend.",4,5,1
"Rexulti","GradStudent048","May 25, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I’m back! I posted nearly 2 years ago on July 5, 2018 when I had been on Rexulti for a month. This drug helped me a lot the first few months, and then things just started going downhill. I gained 40 pounds in a matter of about 9 months, and I’m finally at a place now where my psychiatrist and I agree that I don’t need this medication anymore. The weight gain has just been really detrimental for my mental health because body image and eating disorders were part of my triggers. I hope that this medication can help other people and they don’t have to suffer with it fizzling out and causing unprecedented weight gain like it did for me.",5,5,1
"Rexulti","Rivera085","May 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on rexulti 4mg with wellbutrinxl 300mg, zoloft 200mg and adderall 90mg a day. Rexulti is for my depression. Yes I have gained so weight but I feel better on 4mg of rexulti. I need to figure out how to loose weight with this drug. But I also have other thryoid issues that messes with my weight constantly. I would rather be happy and gain a little weight than be miserable. I have come to the conclusion the medications are what you make it. I feel lots of relief from my depression. For years I felt like, even with 2 antidepressants I need something to stabilize me more. This rexulti is the only medication that doesn't change my personality or change who I am as a person.",9,8,1
"Rexulti","Kells90","May 1, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Ok, so I've on on Rexulti for a few years now for depression. This is the best advise I can give someone thinking about taking this Medication. Currently I am on 2mg, I take it for major depression. My Dr started me off on 1mg. It seems like I had side efforts from the drug in the beginning. Dry mouth, weight gain, irritable and fatigue. So I started taking it at night. After about 2 weeks I then switched to morning again. Side efforts went away except for me eating :(. Overall its a good drug if it helps. I would recommend it. DOWNSIDE: do not just stop taking the drug! You most taper down on the medication. You will have effects if you just stop taking it. For example MOODY as heck. Then it takes a few days to build the medicine back up in your body for it to go away.",8,4,1
"Rexulti","Anonymous","April 30, 2020","-","Took one sample and had a terrible reaction four hours later. Hot/cold flashes, sweating, flashing lights in eyes. Had to run to the bathroom to vomit. Had a similar reaction to abilify",1,2,1
"Rexulti","Brando","April 16, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve been taking the 14 day trial pack of REXULTI woman’s on the 9th night, I had the worst most vivid nightmare I’ve had in years. I also was unable to stay asleep for more than 1 hour at a time. I also felt several other side effects that are inconvenient. I do not recommend this if you have severe anxiety as it only works for a short period of time before stopping.",1,4,1
"Rexulti","Ag","March 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medication saved my life. My anxiety was so bad I couldn't take an effective dose of SSRI. Rexulti calmed my anxiety enough I was able to start upping my SSRI and my depression is getting better and better every day. My anxiety is almost nonexistent! I have gained a few pounds but nothing significant and I would rather gain 10 pounds and be happy than be miserable.",9,15,1
"Rexulti","Madalena","February 28, 2020","-","I am a 22 year old female &amp; have been diagnosed with MDD &amp; anxiety. I was prescribed 0.5mgs Rexulti as an add-on to my 20mgs Prozac to alleviate lingering symptoms of depression, lack of motivation/energy,&amp; anxiety. I felt relief from said symptoms the morning after the 3rd dose! Now, I'm excited to wake up in the morning &amp; just live life. I have the perfect balance of happy energy &amp; calmness that makes going to school, doing daily life things, hygiene &amp; self-care tasks, &amp; social activities enjoyable and fulfilling. My social anxiety is gone, I am bubbly &amp; eager to engage with others, I am excited &amp; motivated to do school work, &amp; I quit having negative/self-betraying thoughts &amp; behaviors. The only side affect experienced was an increased appetite for the first week of the medication, but that symptom subsided within a week. I know there are plenty of negative reviews on here, but I HIGHLY recommend giving it a try. I feel like I have my life/personality back.",10,43,1
"Rexulti","Pepper1981","February 20, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was given Rexulti for add on for depression. At the time I was constantly in a dark place. Lots of thinking of death. Not suicidal. It helped overnight. However, I had some bad side effects. Tardive dyskinesia of the mouth. Although not in the way this condition is talked about. I was unable to chew. It was as if I lost that automatical chewing. I lost weight as I was unable to really eat anything except fluids. I was then put on yet another medication (can't recall the name.) This helped a little but did not help the way I had hoped. I decided to go off the Rexulti cold turkey. And I felt as though I was my body was failing me. Felt worse than the flu. I gave it 2 weeks before I had to start taking it again. Now I am slowly tapering to lower doses. Please listen when I say DO NOT go off cold turkey. I was on 3 mgs. I am now on 2mg and hope to change dose to 1mg next.",2,13,1
"Rexulti","Melancholia","February 19, 2020","-","I have been on Rexulti for approximately a month now, starting at the 0.5mg dose and now am titrating up to 1mg, I’m an 8 day cycle of alternating between the .5mg to 1mg respectively. This medication was prescribed to me as an add on to Persistent Depressive Disorder ( Dysthymia) by my psychiatrist. I am also prescribed Wellbutrin XL 300mg and Cipralex 20mg ... this cocktail seems to help me enough to get up for work and continue my duties in the home life as a husband and father without considering killing myself . Before I was given Rexulti I was semi suicidal daily so I guess it is helping . It is supposed to mood stabilize and give me an extra boost to get going however I do feel somewhat sedated while on this drug especially the days I take 1mg, which to me is not a bad think I would rather feel ok and sedated vs sad but energetic.",8,9,1
"Rexulti","FortMac","February 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Was on 0.5 mg Rexulti for 3 months as an add-on to Mirtazapine for depression. It massively increased my anxiety and caused tremendous restlessness - I couldn’t sit still or concentrate. Have tapered off over a 30 day period and am finally feeling calmer. This medication was just released in the past few years, I feel like it hadn’t been evaluated sufficiently prior.",2,13,1
"Rexulti","McLovin","January 24, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Absolutely horrible experience. My psychiatrist gave me a free two-week sample of 0.5mg Rexulti pills.

"Rexulti","Not myName","January 10, 2020","-","I was on this for Depressive Episode / Delusions. The side effects doctors won’t tell you about that happened to me: high blood sugar, high blood pressure, fast weight gain, lethargy, heart palpitations, constant panic attacks, insomnia, migraines, stomach and digestive issues, and much much more that ruined my entire summer.  BTW: it only  works  for two weeks to a month then it stops completely as shown by literally half of the reviews on this. Disgusting. Put in more research before shoving in experimental antipsychotics into peoples mouths whenever they even feel a tad bit sad.",1,24,1
"Rexulti","Shawn","October 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","For those that like this med Rexulti  but stop because they gain weight, I'm on the keto (low carb) diet and you will not gain weight. You have to stick to it.",9,50,1
"Rexulti","Emma","August 24, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Been on it for a month, and I don’t think I can continue this medication. it must be too strong for me because it makes me feel like I’m dreaming, and makes my body feel so so strange and numb. Kind of like when your legs fall asleep, but all over and for hours and hours! I think it’s helped my anxiety, but I can’t stand feeling numb!! Also makes my head so foggy I felt like I was drugged all day today.",6,24,1
"Rexulti","Margo","August 20, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was diagnosed with panic disorder about 5 years ago. Under that umbrella includes agoraphobia, anxiety and depression, GAD and PTSD. I am a forensic pathologist and realize these come with the job. I started out on Zoloft and the absolutely awful Xanax (2.0 mg qd). After 3.5 yrs of self-prescribing with my family doctor I began seeing a psychiatrist. Over a year later I have been on Pristiq (100 mg) and Xanax (0.5 mg). I wasn’t feeling any better during this time and was given Buspar, Wellbutrin and Seroquel, none of which I took for more than a couple of days. I was zonked out from this mix. I began Rexulti one week ago and have seen incredible improvement in mood and energy. I’m only on the first baby step and am hoping this will help me wean off Xanax. I have not had any bad side effects so far and have actually lost weight. I’m already on a low sugar diet and gym at least three days a week. Keeping fingers crossed",7,52,1
"Rexulti","lrivera1902","August 9, 2019","-","This is my 3rd time trying Rexulti. Honestly, the first 2 times I took this medication my other psychiatrist only gave me 2mg. It did not work for me. But, I switched psychiatrist and they gave me 4mg for my depression. What a major difference. I am on weight watchers freestyle and I actually lost 3lbs on this medication while doing this program. Yes, it can cause weight gain. But, as soon as I started taking this medication I immediately went on weight watchers freestyle. The only thing is my sugar was high when I got blood work.  You really need to watch your sugar when on this medication and eat a healthy diet. People say this medication causes weight gain so you have to be really careful and watch what you eat.",10,30,1

"Rexulti","Genesis11","June 17, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was prescribed Rexulti as an add on medication to several other antidepressants that I had been taking for several years. The other medications worked wonderfully for about 4 years but then I began to experience some relapse of depression and anxiety symptoms. and that is when my doc recommended I start on Rexulti. She started me on a low dose of .25mg/day and slowly worked up to the target dose of 2mg/day. It worked quickly (within 7 days) and I started to feel much better. It wiped out the depression and anxiety and I felt so normal and able to handle life. No side effects for me. I can still experience a normal range of emotions too.",10,95,1
"Rexulti","kris","May 17, 2019","-","Hello! I am and 18 year old girl and I have a hell of a story.  I was put on zoloft for a long time - maybe 3 years, so I started when I was 15 years old which  was when I was diagnosed with depression. 3 years went by and I started getting worse and worse. They misdiagnosed me - I really had bipolar disorder so they then took me off the Zoloft cold turkey. Then they put me on Latuda and Lamictal. Latuda made me throw up 30 minutes after taking it, plus it didn't work. The lamictal did help my mood though,  so they took me off Latuda. I felt so hopeless. That was until about a month and a half ago, when I was put on Rexulti and within a day of taking it, I felt so much better. No joke, this Rexulti is a miracle drug, everything has been so much better. It helps me feel balanced and I don't have severe episodes. It really calmed me down and made me happier. My only complaint is that I had a big appetite within the first two days of taking it. To those searching for a prescription that works- PLEASE at least TRY rexulti.",9,59,1
"Rexulti","Beloved","May 10, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This medicine is hard to rate. While  taking it, I  had never felt better.  Seriously,  my depression was gone, I felt like getting out again.  I felt like I had my life back, BUT I  began having cravings like I had never had before.  I was eating uncontrollably.  I  was getting up in the middle of the night to eat. I  have never had this behavior before and I'm in my 40's. In the past, if I began gaining weight,  I  immediately talked to the doctor and had my medication  switched.  However,  this time,  I was conflicted.  The way I felt taking Rexulti felt like a miracle and I hated the idea of quitting,  until.....I gained  70lbs!! I even gained  20 lbs in 3 days. I finally felt I had no choice but to stop Rexulti. I've been miserable for almost two years now.  I've recently lost 23 lbs, but it has been so difficult.  If I could go back, I would have switched after the first 10 lbs!! Sometimes,  it feels like a no win situation.  I'm committed to losing weight.  I've got to do this!",5,53,1
"Rexulti","B","May 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Rexulti works if you are in a rough spot, but I have gained 80 lbs using this. My brain works, but the weight gain is not healthy for me. My doctor and I have agreed to discontinue this medication and are looking into alternatives. I lost 15 pounds the first week I lowered my dosage in half. I will continue to reduce dosage until it is out of my system. Anyone that uses this I would recommend keeping tabs and seeing what effect it has on your body during the first few months.",5,32,1
"Rexulti","Brittany","May 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My problems are Bi-Polar disorder, anxiety, depression. I was switched from Latuda 80mg to Rexulti (which my doctor pushed on me and had samples). I also take Adderall, Prozac. I started having tremors, and the biggest panic attack in my life that I ended up in the hospital. I didn’t know what was wrong with me so I switched to an NP there. We both thought it was the Adderall making me tremor, this morning NO TREMORS. I went back to Ability 10mg at night with my other usual meds! This med is NOT for people with non-polar disorder, it will make you worse. I’m sure it will help with depression but they have no proven facts stating that Rexulti is for non-polar. Studies actually made it clear it made bi-polar worse.",0,16,2
"Rexulti","Matt","April 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on Lexapro for many years, 20 mg/day.  It helped with anxiety but not really for my depression.  Began Rexulti and is started working within 2 days.  I started at 0.5 mg and worked myself up to 2 mg/day.  I have significantly increased energy and went from sleeping 8 hours to 6 hours a night.

My doctor prescribed rexulti and I’ve been on it for a month. I feel like I have my life back. I feel better than I have felt before even on Prozac.

I remember waking up feeling normal again. I take it as an add on to my anti-depressant Mirtazapine. I gained weight at the beginning but I was able to shed it off shortly after. I have some extrapyramidal effects but nothing weird. I just feel a weird twitch in a muscle every now and then. I keep an eye on it though. Other than that, no other bad side effects. I would give it a chance if your anti-depressant isn't doing enough. I take 1mg.",10,44,2

I was taking it in conjunction with Cipralex (20 mg) which I’ve been on for 8 years. I was taking 0.5 mg of Rexulti for the past 3 months and my energy levels were great. Unfortunately it made me gain 20 pounds in that time. My appetite was out of control... seriously, I was eating out like 4-5 times per week and binging at night. Insane. I just went off of it close to 2 weeks ago and after 2 days my appetite went back to normal. I just can’t be on antipsychotics.",5,18,2
"Rexulti","crazydude81","October 18, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Dear God, save me from this drug.I took this for 2-3 months, violently sick 2 my stomach daily. My doc tried a variety of antidiarrea pills to no avail; I lived in the bathroom. I worked to d/c thru a slow taper, causing the worst drug w/d I've ever encountered. Going from 2mg to 1mg I threw up IN my car TWICE, &amp; walked around w/intense nausea. I had to taper at a 1/4 mg after that, sick throughout. I eventually got off-a near wk ago, &amp; bc of its lovely 91 hr 1/2 life I'm still stuck in the bathroom. I wake up nightly, rushing to the bathroom. It's lightening-up but better has never been such a relative word. I guess a decrease from 20+ trips without warning to 7-8 times with a manageable 15 minute daytime warning is an improvement, but it's not quality of life. No prior major stomach issues, just this nasty pill that's caused a complete life interruption. At the very start of a stomach issue I'd advise tapering off, there is no drug known to man that can control Rexulti's effects on your GI track.",1,21,2

I am one of the lucky ones I suppose, because within hours I knew I had just won my own personal lottery - a med combo that worked for me. I now know what I have never known my whole life -  what it's like to feel normal. I feel like this drug combo saved my life. My wife and kids do too best of luck to those struggling, because it took me 36 years to get the combination right. Tried it all. I recommend trying this combo to all.  If it doesn't work, keep trying. It's worth the frustration when you feel it for the first time - normalcy.

This past week there is no denying I have more energy. I've gone so long with none, yet this week I am tending to things &amp; have a great outlook. I'm amazed to be feeling this well. Have trouble falling asleep &amp; have slight uneasy/restless feeling, but after so many years feeling like the living dead, I actually welcome a bit of restlessness.

I also felt no different at all and have heard that there is often a difference in how you feel within hours of first dose.  Second time I took it at night thinking that maybe I wouldn't be affected by sleepiness then.  I was still so tired the next day that I couldn't stay awake.  This is not normal for me.  So I didn't take any more.  I can only figure this was due to the med because there were no other changes that should have caused it.",1,12,2

I rated Resulti a 6 because in my experience with this product adjunct to the tricyclics my depression disappeared completely by the 2nd but for me I choose sleep but am very envious of those people who have no bad side effects and good insurance because the cost of this on Medicare will put you in the donut hole",6,11,2
"Rexulti","Abilify to Rexulti","February 8, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was on Abilify for almost ten years, but, as well as it worked, I could not stop gaining weight because I was always starving. My psychiatrist suggested Rexulti, and my weight gain has stopped without a change in diet or exercise.  I take Rexulti for psychotic depression, and it keeps me stable and fully functional. I take 2mg a day at night, because it is sedating. Highly recommended for anyone who wants an alternative to Abilify.",10,19,2
"Rexulti","Blue_eyed_Ukrainian","January 30, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've had good experience with Rexulti. I am struggling with depression at the moment (although diagnosed as Bipolar). At first it gave me headaches and upset stomach. That lasted for a few days. After that, I started feeling so much better. The depression has lifted in about a week and a half to two weeks. No anxiety from this drug. No awful side effects. So far haven't gained any weight on it (fingers crossed).",10,12,2

"Rexulti","Papppiii","October 13, 2017","-","I am on week  4 of Rexulti .  I have to say it has gotten me up and on my feet. Unfortunately it has made my anxiety so bad I feel like I am standing on the edge of a cliff trying to decide which way to turn to stop the discomfort. I have chest pain and just a general unease. No way to relax so I will be stopping this medication as off today.",4,16,3
"Rexulti","Mandi611","October 2, 2017","-","Bad. Feel restless and have anxiety attacks, also gaining weight. Have no energy and have to drink 3-4 cups of coffee every day just to stay awake and not crash my car driving to work. For me, not a good med. Tried Abilify, Seroquel, and Depakote in the past for anger and irritability and those are as bad if not worse than the Rexulti. Been on 20mg Lexapro for anxiety, depression, and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for about 10 years, but it's not working very well any more. Doctor suggested Latuda, going to try that next.",0,14,3

"Rexulti","kirt1111111","August 24, 2017","-","Hi, I take Effexor 150mg for my depression &amp; anxiety but if you know effexor its really only for anxiety, so we tried Effexor WITH Rexulti. Rexulti really takes care of depression where effexor doesn't. I started on .5mg for two weeks and then went up to 1 mg for three weeks, which I'm at now, and then I'm going up to 2mg in the next few days. It really helps with depression. I'm always on my feet, all day, always doing something, and I don't even care. It's not a big deal, even. I just do things. It's so cool, I've been apathetic my whole life, and now it's changed. There are side effects, I get headaches and every time I go up a dose, I have huge mood swings for a few days while my body adjusts. But thats okay. Awesome medication.",0,34,3
"Rexulti","WR2496","August 17, 2017","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been trying different combinations of medicines for a good 6 years. I was put on Trintellex about a year ago, and that helped some, but my depression was still disabling. Recently, I went to my psychiatrist and asked for a change in medication. She decided to add rexulti as an add-on to my Trintellex. The result has been phenomenal. I feel better than I have in years. I have more energy, I'm less anxious, and I've been able to leave my house without feeling overhelmed at all. This medicine has is working VERY well for me.",10,42,3

"Rexulti","skilld","July 6, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Rexulti has been a life changer! I'm on 1mg. I know that's not a lot, but it's worked so well for me. Way less depressed mood than usual. I have Bipolar Type II. This was an add on to Trileptal and it's really been amazing for me. Would definitely recommend to others :)",10,21,3
"Rexulti","LizziP","June 29, 2017","-","I have chronic depression (dysthymia) &amp; anxiety, &amp; the depression worsened recently despite being on Zoloft &amp; Wellbutrin. My psychiatrist suggested we try Rexulti &amp; wean me off the Wellbutrin.  I started on 1mg, &amp; I had a slight headache for the first two days. After that, I felt like I was doing a little better and my husband commented that I was more active than usual. My dose went up to 2mg a couple days ago. Now I feel like I can really tell a difference! I haven't felt depressed, I have more focus and creativity at work, &amp; I've actually had enough motivation to do chores at home. I'm a little restless, which I'll keep an eye on, but I haven't noticed any other side effects besides that and the temporary headache. I'm optimistic!",9,42,3

"Rexulti","squididly face","January 17, 2017","-","Started and have stayed on the very lowest mg. of Rexulti.( for roughly four months) Almost immediately I felt so much better, and as the days went on, I felt alive again. Did have an issue with hot flashes, but it didn't last long. My Pdoc is trying to see if I can get a reduction on the cost of this med. Hope he can, because if not, I have no other med that works for me, and it's back to doomsville again. I have D.I.D., PTSD; anxiety, and panic disorder. This drug really keeps me focused, and on an even emotional keel. Very pleased.",10,65,3

Hot flashes, dizziness, blurred vision, weight gain, bloating, shortness of breath, and suicidal thoughts. My depression feels much worse!

"Rexulti","Justkeepswimming","September 12, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I am on my 3rd week of Rexulti. My doctor gave it to me for major anxiety and depression. My depression is gone and my anxiety is 80 percent better. My pmdd is even better, I no longer walk around under this dark cloud not wanting to live. I can't take ssris. Every med I have been given didn't work or made me suicidal or gave me every side effect in the book. I was scared first trying this because of my usual reactions to medicines, and the fact that it is an a antipsychotic freaked me out. Only side effects are jaw pain, hungry all of the time but haven't gained weight yet. I feel so much better. This medicine saved me! (Knock on wood). Give it a try. By the way, I take it alone.",9,94,3
"Rexulti","Bearsky","August 23, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I'm currently on Day 8 of the Rexulti trial pack (stepping up dosage) and so far so good...except that I feel that it's deadened sex drive.  However, that can be remedied I think.  The benefit is that my painful emotions accompanying serious depression have all but vanished.  And so far I have not experienced any akathisia, which is my most feared side effect from any of the atypical antipsychotics (such as Seroquel).  We'll see how it continues.  Yes, it is quite expensive, but I think MediCal will cover.",8,44,3

"Rexulti","Pamie in Pompano","July 4, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","When my psychiatrist finally put me on 1 mg. of Rexulti, it was a life saver. My latest depressive episode seemed intractable until then, but a major drawback has been sleep interruption, often as early as 3 am. My mind races and it's often more fun to get up than to stay in bed. I rarely sleep beyond 6 am, no matter how late I go to sleep. My much valued afternoon naps have also become infrequent too. I also take Pamelor 75 mg. per day and Seroquel 75 mg. per day. Doctor said that I'd have to come off the Seroquel since it's the same drug family as the Rexulti. Well, I've decided to get off the Rexulti and keep my Seroquel since the Seroquel helps me sleep and wears off by morning. Rexulti is absurdly expensive.",4,20,3

That will not make me happy as weight issues were already a problem. Also a bit troublesome is I am feeling tingling in my arm. from wrist all the way up to my elbow. Tingling numb, soemthing is off. My guess its the rexulti. See doctor on MOnday and will update. If it gets worse I will follow up sooner",8,47,3

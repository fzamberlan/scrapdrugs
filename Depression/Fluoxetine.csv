So far I've experienced a big decrease in appetite, which has been okay. The two major things that this drug has changed for me is that it's made me calm and collected and it makes me worry/stress less. The thoughts and problems that usually fill in my head don't affect me as much anymore and I get over things much quicker, which has led to decreasing my stress and my severe anxiety. I've also felt very calm and mellow, which could turn some people off but for me it has been a blessing. I've always not been able to stay still or focus, and am very scatterbrained, so this is a huge change that I've welcomed. It has helped me actually get things done and focus, and has made me much more productive since I actually have the motivation to do things now. Thanks for reading, I wish all of you luck on Prozac!

My midwife said that one antidepressant doesn't work for everyone, it is like putting your hand in a mixed candy jar and pulling one out, the effects are that unpredictable.  Prozac has been amazing for me.  It has taken the OCD, hopelessness edge off so now I feel like I have a choice about how I feel. Side effects included feeling nauseous and having diarrhea on the first day, my husband says I sometimes tremor at night, it doesn't work as well when I am on my period, and I often feel really low after having sex.

I was extremely impulsive and took 3 overdoses on Prozac and was admitted to a psychiatric ward for adolescents.

Additionally, the side effects that I suffer on Prozac are not worth the marginal lack of hopeless feelings. I felt nauseous, hollow, scattered and my libido completely vanished.

I think Prozac made it possible for me to finish grad school and has helped my career.

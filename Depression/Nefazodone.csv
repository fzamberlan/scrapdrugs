"Nefazodone","Zsa Zsa","March 18, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 After having a baby in 1991 I came down with postpartum depression. I tried everything on the market.  I went through a few doctors, a few hospital stays and a few experiences with charcoal due to no longer wanting to fight to exist any longer.  Finally my doctor tried one last medication on me as I wouldn't take anything that affected my weight (gaining), my sex drive or could cause Tardive dyskinesia.  My doctor started me on  Nefazodone, a generic for Serzone.  What a difference Nefazodone made in my life.  My Doc found a dose that worked for me until my mother passed away. That's when he added Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. I am now off of the Lamictal, but, continued the Nefazodone taking two 100mg a day at bedtime,  I am finally at a pretty happy spot in my life and I know that without my amazing therapist and Nefazodone I wouldn't be here today!!!",0,2,1
"Nefazodone","Dee","July 21, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I've read comments about not being able 2 get serzone which is true but I live in Pa &amp; I get the generic Nefazodone. Thank goodness this is still available I hope they never take this off the market. I've been taking it for years. It's the only thing that works 4 me. I get my regular liver function test every 6 months but it's the best",10,8,1
"Nefazodone","Reviewer321","July 19, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I had some success with nefazadone for anxiety and depression but it has caused liver problems. My liver panels are huge and I have experienced jaundice after having a healthy liver all my life.",1,7,1
"Nefazodone","Birdie Girl","June 8, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 I was first diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks and social anxiety disorder about 18 years ago. Under the guidance of a psychiatrist and a psychologist, I was prescribed a fairly new drug - Serzone. Relief came within 1/2 hour after taking my first dose. I have no side effects. It is a fabulous drug.",0,25,1
"Nefazodone","Decades","February 25, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","Been on Serzone / Nefazodone 22 years. My liver has been fine for 22 years, this Medicine Saved my Life, and was the only thing that worked for me ! Right now it is on Manufacturer Backorder till April. I got enough to last, it has saved my Life, PLEASE never discontinue this lifesaver for some of us, especially those of us who have been on it long term like me for 22 years",10,19,1
"Nefazodone","valley70","February 23, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 I went on Elavil to try to help severe migraine. While it was somewhat helpful for the headaches, it immediately began making me gain weight. I put on 40 pounds, and it was a shock because I had never been overweight before. I was 42. I changed doctors, and she put me on Serzone. Within a week I dropped 4 pounds! I was so excited, I began walking again and trying to lose weight. Overall, I lost the 40 pounds and kept it off. Then Serzone was banned, and I had to change antidepressants. The weight piled on, and in six months I gained 60 pounds on Cymbalta. Now, I’m in my late 60s and my new doctor refuses to let me try Nefazodone , which is now available again. I’m so angry. I’ve dropped that doc and am going to a new psychiatrist next week. Here’s hoping she is more brave and understanding and will let me switch to Nefazodone. I hope I can still lose weight even though I’m 25 years older. Being overweight makes me more depressed than any of my life’s problems.",0,23,1
"Nefazodone","Nicole7832","February 10, 2018","-","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 Serzone was a miracle drug for me.  I’ve tried almost every anti-depressant and they all had horrible side effects and did nothing to alleviate my depression.  Serzone made me feel like I could finally see things clearly.  I felt as if a veil had been lifted and no longer felt like I was in a fog.  Whereas before going for a walk, cleaning house, self-care seemed like a monumental feat, after serzone everything became easy.  I didn’t feel like these tasks were an insurmountable  hurdle.  Basic tasks became simple and I could finally see beyond my depression.  I write this now as I’m back to suffering severe depression and searching for a drug similar to serzone as I think they took it off the market.",0,32,1
"Nefazodone","Teton","December 24, 2017","-","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 I was in a major depression after my baby died in the second trimester. Thoughts of suicide, the works. When I finally reached out for help I was put on serzone....truly a miracle drug. I was young, 28 and never had side effects. After a year I weaned off. Three years later I had my daughter and started spiralling downward, post partum - after you have a baby it is supposed to be the happiest time!  I reached out for help and could no longer obtain serzone. I have literally been on EVERY antidepressant for the past 16 years. Nothing has worked like serzone. I am in a bad spot depression-wise again and am thinking it will be worth the liver risk to try to feel normal again.",0,22,1
"Nefazodone","Jenna1201","September 21, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I had high hopes for this med based on reviews and pharmacological profile, however I was unable to get through the initiation period. It felt as if I was very intoxicated with a bad hangover at the same time; dizziness, blurred vision, unsteady gait with stumbling and falling, horrible stomach cramping and dry heaving with a migraine. I started at 100mg at bedtime, and as the days went on, the side effects progressed. I also felt more depressed, but who wouldn't being unable to function. I wish it had worked out better. Everyone is different. My advise would be, if you experience side effects of the nature I did, I would discontinue and save yourself from dealing with them being much worse. Otherwise, give it a try!",3,11,1
"Nefazodone","Anonymous","June 4, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I first started taking Serzone after a brain injury in 1987 it work great, then they decide to take it off the market.  I then took the generic Nefazodone  and it has help me more then other drugs for depression. I wish they kept the Serzone it did work better, but the only one I could tolerate was Nefazodone every other drug made me sick. PS it is hard to get the prescription filled in the Seattle area.",10,15,1
"Nefazodone","Wibblet","January 16, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Nefazodone was finally the first antidepressant to work for me. Unfortunately, six months into the treatment I started losing my memory and cognitive abilities. It's been six months since I've stopped the Nefazodone and I still haven't gotten my memory back fully. I'm honestly scared right now because it feels permanent. I looked it up online and other people have gotten the same side effect. At first I chose memory loss over depression but then it got the point where if I just took my medicine I wouldn't remember if I took it or not. So I chose depression over memory loss. Now I'm depressed again and have memory loss.",5,18,1
"Nefazodone","xjb99mr","July 17, 2015","-","Nefazodone changed my life. I have taken it for 17 years. Within ten days of first taking it, I stopped dwelling on negative things in life, found myself laughing more thanI had since I was a teen. And, my communication skills increased dramatically. No more brain farts, searching for words from time to time.  I get blood tests 4 times a year to be liver safe. Nefazodone taken in evening,helps you sleep too. It's a wonder drug",10,33,1
"Nefazodone","Anonymous","January 11, 2015","Taken for 10 years or more","This was the 5th med I tried for anxiety/depression and it changed my life.  After only a week or so, I laughed again.  It gave me my life back.  Had to ween off, for about a year no insurance and it's kinda expensive.  Serzone, then nefazodone, was a miracle for me.  No side effects except a little nausea in the morning if I didn't eat something first, then that went away.",10,32,1
"Nefazodone","An RN from PA","December 27, 2014","Taken for 5 to 10 years","<b>Serzone (nefazodone):</b>			 My PCP prescribed Serzone for me after I described typical symptoms of depression. As an RN I didn't want to feel medicated &amp; never did. This medicine gave me back  myself. I was on it for about 4 yrs then switched to Paxil for about 2 yrs and then taken off all together. I haven't been on any medicines for depression in 7 yrs as my divorce is long over &amp; I am well healed - Amen! I would recommend Serzone   regular lab work &amp; doctor's care. Also, talk therapy helps too!",0,53,1
"Nefazodone","zag","November 17, 2014","-","I have been taking this medicine since it's been out on the market, I remember my doctor telling me it was new and give it a try.  I felt like that is when all the cog works of my brain started working in conjunction with one another.  I could see life as it really was.  It actually gives me headaches, but after trying about 20 diff medicines, this works.  I take it with Topamax and Wellbutrin.  20 years on a medicine isn't bad.",9,17,1
"Nefazodone","Boomvang","February 15, 2014","-","Like others have posted nefazodone (as Serzone then) saved me when traditional SSRI's made me even more anxious. The fog of depression I was walking around in started to lift in a couple of months. It was 10 years ago. I think I was taking bupropion in the day and trazodone for sleep. But it was the nefazodone that snapped me out of it. Took if for a year almost to the day at which point I didn't need it anymore (I had already stopped taking the other two). The only side effect was early on and it went away after a month: after urinating I felt like I still needed to go. Like another poster, I felt cured. 10 years later, financial and work stress have taken me down again. I started nefazodone &amp; bupropion again. Too soon to tell...",10,25,1

"Nefazodone","SanFranciscoRichard","April 3, 2013","-","I tried multiple SSRIs for my clinical diagnosis of Major Depression over several years. Most of the popular SSRIs resulted in Erectile Dysfunction, which was maddening. Once I ramped up on the maximum 600MG dosage of Nefazodone over several months...I started feeling much better in terms of mood. The additional prescription of Lithium Carbonate augmented the Nefazodone after only three days of taking it: For me, it was an amazing combination.",10,14,1

I no longer suffer from debilitating anxiety and depression and am pretty well cured of the social phobia I used to have.

It truly is a miracle medicine and should not get the bad rap.  I never had any liver problems, in fact I only had dry mouth as a side-effect.  It did not affect my libido or ability like the Cymbalta that I am on now.  I had liver problems with Depakote ER and I don't understand why it does not get the negative press.

Turns out they were caused by stress &amp; serious depression.  The Serzone was a miracle drug for me!  I saw the world so much more clearly and without the negative lens.  My headaches were gone (turns out it actually has a patent for preventing migraines!).  I was on it for 8 years until I moved to a new city and had trouble finding doctors to write for it.  So I was off it the last two years, and my doctor had me on awful Depakote instead.  I hated it!  I found a doctor this week to put me back on Nefazodone (Serzone).  I look forward to ramping up the dosage and feeling alive again!  It was a great drug for me without sexual side effects, which is important to many men.",0,68,2

I have tried so many other SSRI's that did not work so I am hoping that this class of drug will. I wish people wouldn't worry about the the liver issue. Depakote and Cymbalta both have the same risk but they haven't been pulled off the market due to the bad rap. I decided to try Serzone regardless of the liver issue. I will have my liver checked at least every 6 months and if it becomes abnormal, I will stop taking Serzone. No big deal. It is as simple as that. But I read that the risk is only about 1 in 250,000. I will take those odds if this drug really helps me. So far I feel drowsy but I can live with that. The alternative is debilitating fatigue and horrible negativity.",0,57,2

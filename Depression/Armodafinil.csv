"Armodafinil","Anonymous","May 23, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Does not work for improving apathy or empathy. Actually makes depression worse with duloxetine.",1,1,1
"Armodafinil","Dave T","January 2, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","armodafinil is a miracle drug for me. I take it in addition to Lexapro and Klonipin. However, it only works for a few days, then I have to take a few days off. I'm still giving it a 10 because a few days relief at a time is still a miracle. Start low and adjust dosage slowly, because higher dosages can make you hyper. My daily dosage is 1/2 of a 250mg Note: I know Nuvigil hasn't been around 10 years, but before Nuvigil I took Provigil, and it worked well too",10,5,1
"Armodafinil","Flat without","September 27, 2019","Taken for 1 to 2 years","My boy died and I was devastated. My psychiatrist had given me Provigil to help me when my mother passed away. Now, I am completely alone. I took Nuvigil in order to meet with his widow and plan his funeral. I was able to concentrate to get through it. That was over three years ago. Now I take it when I know there is something I have to do. When the grief overwhelms me I take the Nuvigil. 50  or whatever the low dose is. I am better off when I take it, makes me feel like my old self again.",10,8,1
"Armodafinil","dianemob","July 13, 2019","-","I've had severe treatment resistant depression for 25 years. I tried meds, ect, tms but nothing worked. 3 years ago I was taking 4 prozac, and 2 lamictal and I was still extremely depressed. 3 years ago my doctor decided to try Nuvigil. It saved my life. And also gave me my life back. Within 1 hour after the first dose I was back to normal. I started being more social, finding hobbies, and most important of all - I had peace of mind.",10,23,1
"Armodafinil","Helpless until well","February 23, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I have Depression. The reason for sadness that includes several other conditions. Acute stress disorder, anxiety etc. May not work for you. Need a psychiatrist to get as much medicine as I do. I take Nuvigil brand name 250 mg 3 times a day, with Viibryd 20 mg 3 times a day and Enlyte (red soft capsule) 3 times a day. They have saved my life. Without these my life was miserable. I pray one day I won’t need it. I aged and then was in ICU after an operation. Life changed for me after that. Insurance won’t cover Enylte yet. I get it from the Enlyte company without a prescription cost me $150.00 a month. Need a prescription at pharmacy for it.",10,7,1
"Armodafinil","Didee","March 13, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I have suffered from treatment resistant. severe, chronic depression for 25 years. Tried all meds wchich either didn't work or quit working, or side effects were not tolerable. I've had ECT and TMS also.  About a year and a half ago my doctor prescribed Nuvigil. It saved my life! No side effects, works within an hour. It does wear off in the evening and sometimes I become depressed but I know that the next day I will be OK, unlike the endless hopelessness of depression without Nuvigil. I can't understand why none of the drug companies will conduct tests and use it to help more people in my situation.",10,35,1
"Armodafinil","Lifelong depression struggle","May 21, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I take Seroquel XR, it helps with the depression but makes me tired. I am taking 250mg Nuvigil to give me a bit of energy. It seems to take two hours to really hit, then I get a rush of anxiety. That last for about ninety minutes.  It smooths out about 3 and a half hours in. Then at 5 hours there is a drop-off. I get lethargic and a bit down for an hour or so, then the evening is largely the best period.  It does seem to help, but it also hurts. I don't know. I never do.",0,16,1
"Armodafinil","Callie1217","May 10, 2017","-","I've taken nuvigil off and on for about a year, along with 20mg lexapro. I take it as needed for depression and daytime sleepiness (I was falling asleep while driving). I find that it makes me agitated and irritable if I take it every day, so I only take 150mg when my depression is causing extreme lethargy and lack of motivation.  When I do take it, it usually works within an hour. I am motivated, focused, and productive on this medication. It even helps with my social anxiety, and I find that I'm more cheery and outgoing. I'm more talkative too, but in a good way - not in a manic way.  The problem? It wears off after 6-8 hours, sometimes leaving me with a headache. Overall, however, it has been a big help to me!",8,23,1
"Armodafinil","davetrindle","November 27, 2016","-","Immediate lifting of depression; gave me my life back. Best to take 1/2 of 250mg very early on empty stomach with lots of water. I find it best taken around 5 am, go back to bed and wake later feeling great. Take another half before noon if needed, but, again, have an empty stomach and big glass of water. After a week or so, effects not as strong and can make you feel paradoxically very tired. Take 2-3 days off, and it will resume working. Be cautious and mindful of how your personality may be affected; reduce dosage if you're getting too happy overly friendly and too talkative. Also, it really focuses you and its good to make an effort to break the hyperconcentration by taking a break, a walk outside, hot shower. I've been taking 4 yrs",10,28,1
"Armodafinil","FLUFFHEAD","November 20, 2016","-","Nuvigil has given me myself and my life back and I am so grateful! My doc first gave it to me about 7 years ago. The script was for 5-10 days. Tried it again a few years later after a bad episode and again for 5-10 days. It was like a magical pill that within 1 day snapped me out of a rough episode! Fast forward to this past April or May, probably my worst depressive episode ever started in March. Anyway, started back on nuvigil as an ongoing med. NOTHING! Ran out and couldn't get to my doc so I ran out. So glad I did bc I got back on it Thursday night and I was feeling better Friday! I do take other antidepressants so I don't know how this works on its own. I never post here but had to in hopes that my story will help someone!",10,28,1
"Armodafinil","DPac","April 14, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Nuvigil worked the first day and did nothing thereafter. I was using it to alleviate the sleepiness and lethargy from Zoloft.",0,25,1
"Armodafinil","BurtBurt","April 9, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Provigil then Nuvigil (slightly less expensive) helped save my life.  Took Provigil first, switched to Nuvigil (same effect), for 6.5 years now.  Day one value, no side effects as far as I know.  Still same dose (250mg Nuvigil, equivalent of 200mg Provigil), never increased or decreased.  Effect same today as day one.  Note:  I've been on a cocktail:  20mg Lexapro and 1mg Klonopin daily, plus daily mindfulness meditation and weekly CBT. But 6.5 years of lovely life after 3 terrible episodes of major depression in under 6 years.  Certainly have ups and downs, but not severe and brief.  If I run out for a few days I'm grumpier, less resilient but Nuvigil greatly clarifies my thinking and energizes me.  It's not for all, but miracle for me.",0,76,1
"Armodafinil","Onnie Rose","April 4, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I found Nuvigal to bring my life back from depression. Before Nuvigal I couldn't keep my eyes open and live my normal life with 3 boys! Now, after Nuvigal I can actually play with my kids and be a normal mother. I don't know where I would be without it. It really turned my life around for the best!",0,62,1
"Armodafinil","Joan65","March 2, 2013","Taken for 5 to 10 years","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Nuvigil make me feel dizzy, tired and lazy. Nuvigil does dull appetite to the point of being forgetful on me, I will go back to Provigil.",0,16,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","November 9, 2012","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Excellent response but it induces tachyphalaxisis,i.e.  the effect wears off staying at same dose.  With a break of 3 days efficacy comes back.",0,42,1
"Armodafinil","not a fan","January 7, 2012","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Be careful of medically induced hypo mania. I took this for years. Helped with depression and I decided to put up with increased anxiety and racing thoughts. Without my realizing it, I became extremely manic and caused irrational and destructive behavior. Thank God, switched doctors and medicines (to Lamictal). I wish I had known this can induce manic behavior! Please be careful because mania lies to you and makes you think all is well.",0,43,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","December 11, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 150 mg NuVigil does work somewhat for my depression, but the primary effects wear off after a few hours and I feel more tired than usual. It is better than any SSRI, SNRI, MAOI, atypical, or tricyclic antidepressant that I have taken.",0,36,1
"Armodafinil","JennyLynn4eva","November 14, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I started taking 150mg of Nuvigil with my Staterra. My doctor wanted to wait and see if the Nuvigil worked before discounting Stratterra. Well the first 4 days of Nuvigil at 150mg worked well my doctor decided to up it to 250 mg and now it no longer works at all and in fact I feel very nauseous after I take it.  I am so very disappointed!",0,22,1

"Armodafinil","W-guest","August 26, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 My psychiatrist initially prescribed Nuvigil to enable me to be alert and awake during the day.  I suffer from bad insomnia and I'm being treated for major depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder.  I'd taken Provigil in the past and it seemed to help with depression.  Yesterday I overslept and decided not to take my Provigil fearing it would keep me awake even longer than usual.  That was a huge mistake, I became horribly, morbidly, depressed.  I didn't make that mistake this morning, I took my Nuvigil as usual and my (worse than usual) depression is gone.  I haven't experienced any side effects but I wish Nuvigil would enable me to lose weight like it does many people.  I was on Abilify for a few months and gained several lbs.",0,22,1
"Armodafinil","mdd123","August 15, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Started at 150 mg, took half a day and felt like a new person - it changed my life.  Quickly found I need to take the full tablet to get the same effect.  Three months ago doctor increased to 250 mg, take full tablet but the effect only lasts 3-4 hours.  Your body becomes immune and needs more and more.  And now I crash early afternoon and become very  depressed.  Took appetite away, lost 20 lbs in little over a year.",0,28,1
"Armodafinil","MrUbiquitous","July 12, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I have used Provigil and now am on Nuvigil that helps for various issues. I realized I may have an attention problem when I took Provigil for the first time and scored 10-30 points higher than I ever have on a Vocational Rehab. IQ test.  For those of you who are low income, there is a foundation called Cephalon Cares that gives me my medication for free. You have to be under a certain income level but it saves me much money since I do not have insurance either.",0,26,1

"Armodafinil","Melancthon","November 26, 2010","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I have suffered from clinical depression for years. I barely have enough energy to get out of bed. My house is a mess and so am I. My MD put me on 75 mg of Nuvigil and the effects were amazing and instant. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and sleeplessness which both went away after a few days. I am gradually getting more energy and feeling more optimistic. I can see why the Caphalon is investigating this drug for treatment of depression by the FDA. My biggest problem is the cost, as I have no insurance. I can't pay 1/3 of my income each month for a pill. I qualify for the patient assistance program, so will try that. Otherwise I don't know what to do, as the MD has only given me perhaps a month of samples.",0,81,1

"Remeron SolTab","Steve","February 8, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was given this years ago in the hospital and it worked amazingly well for sleep (I think it was name brand). My new insurance now covers it so I had my doctor switch me from regular generic Remeron to generic Remeron Soltab by Aurobindo Pharmaceuticals. The dose is 15mg. I only took it one night so far and it didn’t work at all for sleep &amp; gave me a headache.  I’m not giving it a rating because I believe the reason for it not working is the brand. I had the same issue with Aurobindo’s regular Remeron and had to switch brands. I will have to see if my pharmacist can order a different brand otherwise I will go back to the regular tablets.",0,6,1

"Remeron SolTab","YippeeKaye","September 12, 2017","-","I take Remeron Soltab (Mirtazapine) half an hour before bed for insomnia and depression and it has completely removed all my symptoms. Highly recommend for anyone with insomnia, depression or anxiety. It is also superbly effective for allergies and takes care of my runny and stuffed nose. It may be the strongest yet safest antihistamine for rhinitis. Sleep is good and refreshing. Not taking anything else, not needing anything else. Took me out of a really dangerous time in my life.",10,44,1

"Remeron SolTab","Anonymous","June 10, 2012","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I used this for years and it helped with anxiety, sleep, depression. It caused initial weight gain but was worth it for relief. I stopped it on my own (not smart) because it made me sleep and I had to stay awake for care of my Dad. Now I wish I was back on it. I have been on tons of medicines to try to get stabilized again. Will be asking a doctor about it. It also helped with irritable bowel syndrome.",10,29,1

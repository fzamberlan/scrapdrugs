"Tranylcypromine","camarchie","June 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","<b>Parnate (tranylcypromine):</b>			 I've had dysthymia and episodes of acute double depression (atypical) with anxiety forever but depression for 6 years. Been on Zoloft, Pristiq, Effexor, Brintellix, Prozac, moclobemide bupropion etc. Finally psychiatrist put me on Parnate and it's been amazing really whilst still having some residual symptoms it's almost reset my brain back to how it was before I was depressed. I pay no attention to my diet though I don't drink and I'm not into aged cheeses or meats really but have had them inadvertently without noticing never an issue. Slight increase in appetite but easily mitigated by just walking more and driving less. It's worth a shot for treatment resistant types without doubt. Have seen a friend who was on 600mg Pristiq having crying spells completely transform within 2 weeks of Parnate.",0,1,1

I can laugh again, take things in my stride, wake up with enthusiasm to face the day. My GP said, most people are feeling more depressed right now with the social isolation, uncertainty of the pandemic so this must be working. It took me months of. research and trepidation to try it, after a year of worsening depression due to carer stress. Had tried Zoloft, Pristiq and Lexapro in the past.

"Tranylcypromine","Marcos","February 26, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Parnate (tranylcypromine):</b>			 Parnate did not give me ANY major SIDE EFFECTS. The insomnia was manageable, and the instant benefits felt from day one (no exaggeration) gave me hope that I was on a good track.  For comparison, I have been through Fluoxetine (2 years). It gave me 1 month of side effects and no benefits, but eventually I got better and continued with it. Unfortunately, Fluoxetine stopped working from 6th month or so. But I kept the faith in it. For 2 years. The psychiatrist also put me on Desvenlafaxine. It was a nightmare of headaches that lasted for a day, putting me in bed. For no benefit.

"Tranylcypromine","Dog Friend","January 16, 2020","-","<b>Parnate (tranylcypromine):</b>			 I have taken Parnate for 30+ years. Have low-grade chronic depression. Any time I weaned off Parnate, gained huge weight due to out-of-control appetite as well as lethargy &amp; irritability that makes it impossible to function. Tried 15 other anti-depressants (because of severe hypertensive crises): all failed over time; Parnate is only medication that works. I would like not to take ANY meds, I would like to be able to eat aged cheese, or avocados, have a glass of good wine, eat in a restaurant without having to do major detective work and scare the staff,  but those things are not possible. Parnate is like insulin for a diabetic: it is life-preserving. Side effects you HAVE to deal with. I ended up in emergency twice as a result of tyramine (misled by restaurant staff). Insomnia: I take last dose no later than 2 pm, no caffeine after morning, &amp; when necessary, Imovane to help sleep. Loss of libido &amp; difficulty/inability to achieve orgasm are HUGE trade-offs, but in my case they are trade-offs for life.",0,20,1

Over the last 40 years I've been on virtually every antidepressant.  Nothing lasted more than a few weeks.  I even went as far as having ECT, with terrible results.  30mg of Parnate has kept me from thinking suicidal thoughts and made life bearable again.  The main side effect for me is the dietary restrictions.  Unlike most of the people that have posted their experiences here, I have a very strong reaction to tyramine containing foods.  Four slices of bacon raised my BP to 222/110.  Eating one day old leftover bbq resulted in a trip to the ER.  I keep Hydralazine around for emergencies now.  I know if I eat the wrong thing because I get a throbbing headache within minutes.  Now I am much more careful about the food that I eat.  Only fresh foods and no aged cheese or meats for me now.",0,12,1

Not saying it'll work for you, but if you've tried everything else, go for it. Warning 1: side-effects are a thing, they aren't great (and nightmarish if you have serious anxiety).

It was a miracle drug, until it stopped working and I was more depressed than I had ever been before.  The psychiatrist I went to see put me on Parnate.  It is a relief from the depression. It does work and like other people I have not had a problem with food.  My blood pressure was low after taking Parnate so I tried some foods - cheese in particular and I have had no problem with the diet   the problem is insomnia. I rarely get more than two or three hours sleep and that affects everything in my life.  Even though I don’t sleep some days I have lots of energy; other days I am temperamental  because of the lack of sleep.  I hope I can find a psychiatrist soon who will prescribe something so I can sleep. The county I  just moved to has one psychiatrist that accepts Medicare but is not taking new patients.

I had severe treatment resistant atypical depression for three years. Over that time they put me on 10 different antidepressants in various combinations and nothing worked. I did my own research and made my psychiatrist put me on it. Within a week I was fine. I would without a doubt be dead without Parnate.  I regularly eat aged cheese and cured meats etc and have never had any food reaction. However, if I drink beer or red wine I do have a minor reaction - sounds weird but I grind my teeth and can just tell it’s reacting with the Parnate. Side effects are very minimal - dry mouth; bit of agitation etc (though that could be from my anxiety issues - which are also significantly reduced on the Parnate). The agitation was worse when I was on 60mg, but now I’m down to 30mg it’s fine.

Anxious for relief, I increased dose too fast, and as a result (I believe), on day 7, I had a Hypertensive crisis.  I did not go to hospital or disclose to doctor.  I would rather die than be taken off Parnate without giving it a chance.  On day 9, I felt great!  Lots of energy, motivation and felt happy.  I was able to go on errands, visit family, talk on the phone (big phobia). Despite the occasional cycling, Parnate saved my life and has given me some hope.  I know I need to add a mood stabilizer, but I am afraid of messing with something that's good enough.  I am lucky that the food restrictions are unnecessary for me.  I also went back on Adderall, despite the warnings, 40 mg per day, which has helped a lot.  My BP is normal.  Check out research by Dr. Ken Gillman",0,34,1

The first couple months or so on Parnate will be a little rough since it tends to sedate you during the day and keep you up at night but this effect usually diminishes with time. As echoed by people here, the diet is pretty overstated. There are very few foods that will actually cause a hypertensive crisis. You will be fine as long as you don't binge on fancy cheeses, cured meats or eat spoiled food. Not a lot of docs know this but you can also combine it with TCAs and stimulants if it doesn't completely resolve your depression on its own.

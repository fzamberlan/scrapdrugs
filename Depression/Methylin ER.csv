"Methylin ER","meyotch","October 21, 2013","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been diagnosed with ADD at the age of 42 and have struggled with major depression since adolescence. I currently take 10mg Methylin ER and 150mg bupropion XL in the morning. In the evenings I take 50mg of trazadone for sleep. 3 weeks now and I have never felt better. The adjustment period was pretty mild. Just a bit 'jazzed' in the morning and very mild nausea in the evening. This gradually faded over a week. My appetite is returning, my diet improving and I am reconnecting socially. My sleep is good and I awaken fully alert with the sunrise. I can't believe how dramatic this change is. I am optimistic that I will be able to dig myself out of the hole I've been in and re-build a life.",9,119,1
"Methylin ER","Finally Happy","March 21, 2008","-","I've been on antidepressants from the old style to the newer SSRI's, SNRI's and others and nothing worked. My doctor suggested Methylin ER and my depression lifted in two days and I haven't had a relapse. It's been about a year now and I'm still as happy as can be. I don't sleep for 12 hours or more anymore either. I can wake fully rested with 8 hours sleep and do anything my heart desires. Methylin ER is truly amazing and I'll never go back to an antidepressant as long as this keeps working.",10,262,1

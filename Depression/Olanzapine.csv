I took it for 2 years and my new Dr took me off it. I put on 30kgs of weight, felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin on a daily basis and was very irritable. But thats not the worst part. This medication permanently causes you to be DEPRESSED even after discontinuation! I've tried all types of SSRI's and SSNRI's and they simply don't work. I'm stuck in an incredibly bad depressive state, I can't laugh, I can't be happy. PLEASE, if your Dr. prescribes this to you, READ THE REVIEWS and do not take this horrible medication!",1,7,1

"Olanzapine","Lasered","February 7, 2020","-","I have had depression and anxiety for many years. I believe my psychiatrist falsely diagnosed me as having mild psychosis because of my description of my traumatic history in an unusual religious culture. I talked about demons but was not experiencing voices, images or delusions. It was just part of the culture. Olanzapine ruined my physical health - high blood pressure, severe weight gain and continual tiredness. As it sedated me I stopped talking about my issues. This made others think my mental health improved but inside I was suffering the same experience of trauma. I was threatened with detention if I stopped taking the medication until I resisted with legal action. The whole experience caused issues with my finances, my career and my health and I have struggled to recover. Maybe this medication would help with genuine psychotic issues short term but off-label usage caused me harm. I would recommend reading the works of Joanna Moncrieff before taking or prescribing this drug.",1,4,1

In the past year my depression has slowly gotten worse and I suspect it's the Zyprexa. About 3 months ago I decided to taper myself off Zyprexa. I went from 15mg to 7.5mg for 3 months. I experience moderate sleeping issues (I sleep between 4-8 hours and wake up about 10 times during the night), nausea and a dramatic increase in depression.

"Olanzapine","Tookie","September 13, 2019","-","I have been on many different anti depressants for depression and for insomnia/PTSD. So I started on Prozac 20mg a day. I had relatively no side effects! I started sleeping a bit better and wasn't so unhappy.  But I still wasn't feeling myself. So, I read up on add-on type products and found olanzapine as a great combo with Prozac.  I got that prescribed but sat on it for a while because I also read all the horrible side effects and got scared. But after a month still not feeling myself, I decided to try a very small dose.(I read you could split the pill safely),that way it would be easier to get off of it. So, I cut a 5mg into eight pieces... so .625 mg - a couple hours before bed. I slept better than I had in years! I've been taking it for about 2 weeks. I again, lucky, have had zero side effects. I feel AMAZINGLY happy!! I am going to stay on the super low dose.

On the other hand it has subtle side effects such as sleepiness and fatigue (when first taking it), weight gain (which is I guess sorta good in my case since I'm underweight) and some slight extrapyramidal symptoms and spasms.

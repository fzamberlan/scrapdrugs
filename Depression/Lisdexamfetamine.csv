"Lisdexamfetamine","Kennymac","January 22, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been fighting what is deemed to be depression for years. I've got chronic urinary tract problems and advanced Crohn's disease which is likely the cause or greatly contributes to the cause of the depression, fatigue, etc. Long story short after all the psych docs and all the other meds I've been prescribed Vyvanse is the only medication that keeps me up and going. When I've quit taking it for any amount of time I crash and I crash hard.",8,3,1
"Lisdexamfetamine","Mr Clay","June 19, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’m a 39 year old male who suffers from major depressive disorder and chronic fatigue. Things have gotten so bad that I’m on disability and sleep 12-16 hours a day. My doctor prescribed me this in hopes of it boosting my energy. I took my first 30mg dose this morning. For 3 or 4 hours my heart was beating out of my chest and then I crashed. Not a pleasant experience on day 1 probably won’t take this tomorrow",1,5,1
"Lisdexamfetamine","MsUkrainiangirl","June 15, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Everyone is different. Some people like Adderall some people like Vyvanse.  For me personally Vyvanse works much better. I was prescribed Adderall at first for my depression. It worked okay but then kind of stopped working. So I switched to Vyvanse. For me it’s much smoother, more natural type of feeling. Gives me energy throughout the day and lasts longer.  I would definitely recommend trying it. The only side effect for me is loss of appetite so I have to force myself to eat.",9,12,1
"Lisdexamfetamine","Luvlytrinity","August 27, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have been diagnosed with bipolar severe depression/Anxiety disorder And Despite being on Abilify, Prozac and Xanax. I have spent most of my days in bed; No energy what-so-ever. I have also put on 60 pounds. I asked my Psych if there was a way to break this cycle. He prescribed Vyvanse. I started to notice a difference on 30 mg and then he upped to me 50 mg. I have to say that this medication has really given me this new look out on life.  I have more energy now and has given me the ability/ confidence to do things like errands, cooking for my family, interacting with people where as my anxiety prevented me from doing that. I am hoping to return to work one day after being away for 10 years. Its an amazing medication and I am thankful for my psychiatrist. Vyvanse truly does make a difference.",10,22,1

"Lisdexamfetamine","Depression boy","March 17, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Taking Vvyanse for treatment resistant depression, started to notice half life extending from 11 hours to 15 hours. Very unusual. The only other med I've taken that has this half life is modavigil, does anyone have similar experiences",2,2,1
"Lisdexamfetamine","DanDMan2016","April 12, 2016","-","I suffer from paralyzing anxiety that came on when I was 36 and I'm now 40.  I haven't had it for the entire 4 yrs but I'm going theough my 3rd episode now and its brought on by finances and then I suffer a panic attacks which turns into chronic severe bedridden anxiety.  I have the thought that just take over and each thought sends me spiraling and then the depression kicks in which makes it worse.  I'm a father of 1 and married.  Anyway,  I was put on Vyvance and its takes it away for the time its in my system.  I'm gonna try zoloft to help with the depression after it weres off but vyvance at least gives me a glimmer of hope.  I can think clearly so iIhope this is helpful to others",10,7,1

"Lisdexamfetamine","Anonymous","November 19, 2012","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine):</b>			 I am on my third day of taking this now. First day: mild headache that got worse as the day went on, mild upset stomach, sleeping normal, itchy at night. Second day: bouts of nausea, strange uncomfortable feeling, hot and cold flashes, not a good sleep, itchy at night (worse). Third day: Feel really moody, negative and I have a strange feeling, also exhausted. It clearly isn't for me. I don't feel like myself in three days? Kind of scary.",0,8,1
"Lisdexamfetamine","Anonymous","January 2, 2012","-","I was prescribed 20mg of Vyvanse last year after trying different medications for a couple of years without much success. I had found bupropion (Wellbutrin) before after being on SSRIs and felt better immediately after I began taking it. As a result of my mood improving dramatically on more of a stimulant type of medication, and the fact that I smoke cigarettes and drink plenty of coffee, I was prescribed a CNS stimulant to try. My doctor suggested Adderall but I didn't want the up and down mood swings that came with it, so I asked for Vyvanse instead. I moved from 20mg to 30mg a month after I started and haven't looked back. It's a very subtle medication that I find gives me the alertness I need to not feel panicky on a day to day basis.",9,19,1

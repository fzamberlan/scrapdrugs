"Amoxapine","Capricious ME","July 20, 2010","-","<b>Asendin (amoxapine):</b>			 I have used Asendin-amoxapine for at least 20 years off and on. After my last hospitalization for 7 months, I had been on Mirtazapine which I and many others gained 30 lbs from and unable to get it off.  So I am again on amoxapine and doing well and starting to lose weight finally.  It helps a great deal with anxiety, social ability and the feeling of being overwhelmed.  Great medicine.  I sometimes fear I wont be able to get it.",0,69,1

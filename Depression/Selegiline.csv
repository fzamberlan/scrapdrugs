"Selegiline","Jp","February 16, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 Started 25 years ago on Prozac and Paxil. Didn’t work. Tried nardil and felt incredible. Over a 5 year period it seemed to diminish and did not work anymore when they changed the coating on it. Over the next 15 years went through many trials and nothing helped. Started Emsan 9mg a year ago and it has helped. I feel 80%. which is acceptable. I can’t think of any side effects. Cost through ins was $80 but the tech at CVS found a coupon and it is only $20/month. Over the past 6 months have read as many books on anxiety/depression that I could and that has helped even more. I pick up tips that help me with anxiety/depression. Never stop trying!!!!",0,9,1
"Selegiline","Anon","January 9, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 Took this years ago for bipolar, I took it for several months and it caused severely agitated mania.

"Selegiline","Dan","May 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 Currently on Emsam 6mg (selegiline) Such an amazing medication. Feel like myself, tons of energy, very social, and confident. Been on almost every SSRI and loads of other psych meds that have never worked.  The lowest dose of 6mg allows me to eat whatever I want (that I'm not supposed to) not worry about having a hypertensive crisis.  I take 200 mg of 5HTP (the direct precursor to serotonin) a day, too.  Never had any adverse reactions.  Feel great and love life!",0,32,1
"Selegiline","Smirch","April 24, 2019","-","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 I don't need to go into detail here about how terrifying going through your first depressive episode is. I was prescribed 6 mg Emsam. I didn't notice an improvement for the first three weeks. When I was bumped up to 9 mg... I began to laugh again. I was able to FUNCTION again. I'm to a comparable state to where I was before my depressive episode, however with a few alterations in my personality. The negatives: insomnia - It is rare when I am able to sleep through the night. I often wake up in the middle of the night, and have a lot of difficulty falling back asleep. My psychiatrist recommended that I take off the patch before going to bed, but this put me in a really weird mood in the morning. The irritability - I notice that I get frustrated / angry much more easily now and I never felt like this before. This medication has been an absolute lifesaver for me.",0,12,1
"Selegiline","Bobby","January 23, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","Clinically depressed for over 50 years. Used Nardil for 35 years then switched to Emsam. It works well. I sometimes have depression episodes but they do not last more than a few weeks. I take 9MG patch. I started with 12 MG. I eat everything and drink red wine. I have sex 2-3 times a week with no meds. I am energetic, a bike racer, swimmer, golfer, world traveler and I am 80. Living in my RV seven months this year traveling the USA. I think the Emsam-Selegine-Deprenyl is a youth drug. Everyone says they have never seen anyone 80 act like me or have the energy I do. I am loving life. My wife died 13 years ago and I remarried a woman 24 years younger.  I have been on an MAOI for 0ver 50 years and it helped me become quite successful. Always had clear thought patterns, an uplifted attitude and plenty of sex. Does it get any better?  It is a long way from the day I put a 357 Mag in my mouth and almost pulled the trigger. Bobby",8,27,1
"Selegiline","Happy","March 31, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","60 yr old male.  I take 20mg/day of Selegiline, at breakfast, for depression, for over 6 years.  Side effects are two:  a) if I drink coffee in the afternoon I tend not to go to bed before 12:00 AM and b) sometimes it's hard to concentrate and I can get very easily distracted.",9,10,1
"Selegiline","FosterM","December 20, 2017","-","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 Have taken 8 different SSRI medications.  All were beneficial and provided relief.  But all also fizzled out after a period of time. Have been through 2 full treatments of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.  Great relief but for only a 3 month period. Have had 8 treatments of ECT with no benefit. The 12 mg Emsam patch has been a literal life saver for me.  The side effects are a piece of cake as far as I’m concerned.  One rare side effect that I experienced was that it lowered my blood pressure.  I learned that having blood pressure levels normal is really debilitating.   But this medicine has completely and totally lifted my depression...this is  the best I’ve felt since my first continuous bout with depression in 1999!",0,31,1
"Selegiline","Noonesbusiness","March 14, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 I actually struggle with the possibility of bp ii. At 6 MG I didn't have any response positive or negative except that is repressed my appetite, with infrequent feelings of rage,which were controllable with benzos (ativan).  At 9 mg I began to have extreme insomnia (probably because it metabolizes as l-amphetamine or an adderal-like substance). At this dosage the rage I would feel was too much to handle, and was very much similar to what I felt on wellbutrin.  I would caution anyone, if you have rage on wellbutrin, you may (as others have anecdotally said) have feelings of rage on emsam as well. It's worth a try still, however, as when I wasn't feeling intense anger, at 9 mg I did feel better. best of luck.",0,20,1
"Selegiline","dayztyty","November 1, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been dealing with major depression roughly 10 years. Have been on a medley of antidepressants and different combos. Most being SSRI's that seem useless or worsen my depression. Emsam is by far the most effective. I have little if no episodes of suicidal thoughts anymore and life just seems more  managable.this drug actually has promise instead of the many other antidepressants that are just all hype. Definitely worth a try.",9,15,1
"Selegiline","M Rodgers","September 29, 2015","-","Very effective. Diagnosed bipolar type II. Helps a lot with atypical depression type symptoms, like lethargy and slow thought processes. Messes up my sleep though, and can make me a bit cranky and irritable. Anyone know how to deal with the insomnia?

After being diagnosed and trying a few different treatments that had worse side effects than the depression we tried Emsam at the 6mg dose. Almost overnight I noticed a massive improvement. While I tend to go into hypomanic states more often with this, it is controllable and I am more than happy to have this as the major side effect. I have been taking it for almost 2 months at the moment and hope that it keeps rocking!",0,87,1
"Selegiline","gkm","May 20, 2013","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 I have tried what seems like every medicine for my depression and have only experience temporary minor relief of symptoms.  My psychiatrist wanted to try ECT because nothing else was working and I was tired of being in the hospital, but I refused.  She then mentioned that MAOIs(monoamine oxidase inhibitors) can sometimes be helpful for those who don't respond to other medicines so I agreed to try it. It has been a miracle worker for me! I have been on it for about 10 months and I have not had any severe depressive episodes and find myself going through the day without all of the terrible thoughts and cravings that used to haunt me.  I went from extremely suicidal to functioning normally.  I didn't even know I could feel this way!",0,127,1
"Selegiline","AuntieBB","March 25, 2013","-","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 I have been on many pills over and over trying to get my depression/bipolar under control. I would find something but then it would only work for a couple of months then back to square one. Ever since I was put on the Emsam patch I have loved it, I feel more alive, and wanting to get out and do things. I feel better about myself, I do my hair, makeup, and feel like I am part of society again. I have energy and the food restriction hasn't been that big of an issue, it has been a healthy change for me. Yes it is expensive and can have high copays but worth it. I was paying more for all the doctor copays and medicine copays then I am now for the Emsam patch. I would recommend it to everyone!",0,96,1

I was the quintessential invisible man. I tried all the  antidepressants for over 50 years.  Everything was totally useless and with horrible side effects to the extent that one wonders why anyone would prescribe it. The first thing that actually worked was Nardil which opened me to a world of light and color that I didn't know existed, but it had its problems and became ineffective after a time. 6 years ago my doctor finally gave up and gave me this. She started me on the low dose patch which didn't seem to do much  but the fog did lift . I seem to have few if any side effects. Emsam is worth trying.",0,100,1

I'm using Emsam and the ease of use is excellent. I have fibromyalgia and this might also be helping my pain, fatigue, and libido since I've noticed improvement with all. At first I craved sweets but don't now. I have mild irritation at the patch site. I wake up at least once at night to urinate (where I didn't before) and I also want a snack at that time, too. Even with night eating, I think I'm losing weight on this medication. My one concern is that I am definitely losing my hair on this. I will see my psychiatrist next week for a one month follow up and if the hair loss is easily remedied, I'll stick with it. Expensive without insurance.",0,65,1

"Selegiline","Anonymous","March 1, 2012","-","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 Emsam is by far the best antidepressant I have come across in over 20 years of treatment in which I have been given everything under the sun. Welbutrin was ok but was weak, edgy and stops working after about 6 months. I have been on Emsam twice now for stints of about a year each. Unlike other antidepressants it doesn't have that plastic, fake agitaged feeling to it. Feels like natural emotions. It cuts my depression roughly in half. Still suicidal often, but not every moment of every day. I have a severe skin reaction to the adhessive that looks horrific but its worth it. Other than that and worsening insomnia it really doesn't have side effects. Well worth the rash. I have to stay at 6mg because the higher doses produce psychosis in me.",0,68,1
"Selegiline","LKW01915","January 30, 2012","-","<b>Emsam (selegiline):</b>			 I tried EVERYTHING to get over what was first diagnosed as depression (30 years ago).  About 12 years ago I started seeing a psychiatrist who thought I might be bipolar, type 2 (mostly depressive, no full-blown manic state) and started me on Emsam.  It took some time-can't really remember but maybe a month but it works.  Yes, there are side effects-insomnia being the worst but that dissipated in a few months.  We all know that what works for one person may not for another but this is not an SSRI which can't touch depression associated with bipolar.  And you don't have to be bipolar for it to work.  I know it's frustrating but give it a shot-maybe you'll be like me and never have to try another medicine again!",0,89,1

One recent problem however, the refill I picked up in August of this year, 2011, pretty definitely has something wrong with is, as the medicine has become less effective for depression, I've had a pounding heart and I've had noticeable hair thinning problems.

This has been the most effective treatment I've had, lasting the longest with the best results. Side effects have been limited to skin irritation from the patch. The dietary restrictions aren't proving to be too restrictive. On a couple of occasions, I've had food with tyramine by accident. A bad headache for a few hours was the only result. (I didn't realize that I'd had the tyramine until after the headache had come and gone.) The price and need for prior authorization are my only real complaints.",0,62,1

After 1 month I cleaned my house in 1 day and began to shower, dress, apply make up and do my hair every day.  I did not have to think about what need to be done I JUST DID IT.  This was the first time in my life I can ever remember just being ME.  After 6 months I became allergic to the adhesive, I can no longer use Emsam.  What I wouldn't give to once again KNOW WHO I AM.

There are a number of precautions that you must remember to take.  #1  Challenge each doctor to check and see if a new medication will react badly to the Emsam, a lot of the medications have interaction with Emsam.  Also you must give up aged things, like Pepperoni, Salomi, Beer, Wine, and Worchester and Soy sauces.  I learned the hard way about the last 2.

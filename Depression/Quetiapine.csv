After taking 25 mg before bed, well, it’s definitely a sedative. I was basically in between sleep and awake having a panic attack. I had crazy dreams &amp; the next day I feel worse. I don’t plan on taking it anymore because it was an unsettling, for lack of a better word, experience. This wasn’t for me, personally. I used goodrx to only pay $9 for the medication. And PlushCare to talk to an MD for $100.",2,2,1

The dose was increased by 50mg every 3 days. At first I didn't feel any different, then when the dr increased it to 150mg I started seeing and improvement in my mood.

Went back to SSRIs, had 2 failed suicide attempts (SSRI resistant) and a new Dr urged me to go back on quetiapine as it was the only thing working for me. I hated the side effects but knew he was right. Gave it another shot with a new Dr at 150mg/night. He said there ARE WAYS to prevent the negative side effects. Dr said with a proper taper, severe withdrawal won't happen. Life made a complete 180. I take Quetiapine with topamax and Metformin and got in amazing shape! (5’4 110lbs compared to 5’4 160lbs the first time I took it) With a proper Dr I realized how much it helps me. No negative side effects cause we keep my dose as low as possible.

I also suffered from severe insomnia for years. Seroquel has seriously helped with my awful thoughts and improved my self-esteem. I have an easier time with other people and my grades have gone up in school. Unfortunately, some of the side effects are troubling because it's not reliable for insomnia. I can stay awake for 2-3 days or sleep for 20 hours. I'm very tired and I often pass out. I've lost weight and my appetite. Another good thing about it is that it got rid of the horrible hallucinations I have from sleep deprivation that are much worse than my usual ones. My parents and doctor don't like that I'm on this drug. For years, people have been telling me to exercise, eat healthy, sleep well while forgetting that depression makes everything impossible, don't listen to people who say this- you know what works for your body.

I also got some odd feeling of restlessness in my body after each time I took the next pill, especially at 100mg (stopped at 150mg, my highest dose), &amp; going to sleep was the only way the feeling went away.

However, I screwed up and ran out one weekend. So I braced myself for a night without sleep. But the next morning, I had no depression symptoms. I started cutting the pills in half, and have been sleeping, but not having the crippling depression symptoms. Amazing...

I just went down to 150mg per day and already feel better sleepiness wise, even naturally waking up a bit earlier instead of requiring 10+ hours of sleep. In terms of other side effects, I always attributed the cravings and binging to my restriction/eating disorder, but didn't think until now that it may be because of the drug.

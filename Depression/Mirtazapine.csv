"Mirtazapine","Mint","June 4, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was put on this mirtazapine antidepressant after being on Sertraline for 6 months and experiencing serious suicidal thoughts. Not only it helped a lot with depression and anxiety, but this is the perfect medication for someone underweight, like I used to be. I gained over 50lbs within 4 months and kept going lol. Being underweight for so many years I never knew what it feels like to be overweight until I tried it. Well... I definitely feels much better than being underweight, but... time to switch off my meds! :P",9,3,1

"Mirtazapine","Kessie","June 2, 2020","-","Took for about a month, starting on 15 mg a day.  Never been so tired in my life.  Went up to 30 mg because the tiredness is supposed to ease then.  It did slightly but after a few days my skin was like sandpaper and eyes constantly watering, and both very sore.  Didn't really feel better at all mentally, actually worse because I felt I had dropped about 50 IQ points and not able to think clearly to find solutions to problems.  Felt despairing, too despairing to demonstrably show anger but there all the time in my mind, along with the worst depression ever.  I needed to find something that I know I have to live with for the rest of my life.  Took hours to wake up, a few hours where I would be sort of functioning, then go to bed very early, not just because of exhaustion but also because I couldn't do anything anyway because of constantly wiping my eyes.",1,4,1
"Mirtazapine","Chan","May 22, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I've been taking 15mg for a year and 8 months. Right away I felt better because I slept right through anger woke up rested. Previously I took 40mg citalopram and I still suffered bad episodes of depression and delusions. Since taking mirtazapine, I've had much longer periods of productivity, much calmer, less intense periods of sadness and distorted thinking. I stopped the citalopram about 7 months ago, so I'm very happy with it.  The only draw back is that I went up at least a dress size and I can't shift the weight, even though I'm healthier than ever, and don't drink.",9,6,1
"Mirtazapine","Trytrytry","May 18, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","<b>Remeron (mirtazapine):</b>			 I was feeling very depressed 3 years ago and I've always suffered from anxiety, I tried other anti-depressants but the side affects were horrendous so I started on 15mg Mirtazapine, they started to work after a few days. I felt calm and my anxiety reduced hugely, I also slept very well. They will give you very vivid dreams, after a few weeks I started feeling anxious/agitated during the day so I popped another pill and that did the trick after an hour. The Doc upped my dose then to 30mg and they worked great at night. But I felt very anxious in the morning so the Doc  very unusually apparently prescribed 15mg for the morning, that really did the trick. Fast forward 3 years, I'm still on the 45mg and they still help me sleep, my mood however is a little on the low side, anxiety is quite bad, in a nutshell they work less and less the longer you are on them, I'm now thinking of tapering off them and trying some talking therapy even if I am a little sceptical of the value of doing so.",0,2,1

I cannot stop sleeping. Put me in a horrible weird state like I don't know what's going on or like I'm truly awake. Just feel 'out of it' .. Off of a sliver! I have read contradictory things about dosing. I would indeed say and agree with that the lower doses are VERY sedating. Very weirdly vivid (not nightmarish) dreams... I had a gene test done and this medication was on my lower doses maybe be required I can't even imagine what a high dose would do! This is completely staying on my 'NO!' list! Be careful of this medication because it is POWERFUL. I feel like I've just been high for days. Like I've just been smoking the most dank weed and I've just been stuck in this high. When I wake up I feel like I'm manic, like I just have a huge rush of anxiety. I wanted to try this because I am experiencing heartburn like chest pain that isn't acid related at all..",0,5,1

I‘d always been wary of antidepressants because of the well known side effects but being an SSRI I gave this one a shot. Never looked back. Gained maybe 8 pounds but you cant tell because I look and feel so much healthier and happier. Little to no side effects other than that 8 pounds, I can finally sleep again. Woke up a little dizzy in the morning for the first 2 or 3 weeks but it doesn't happen anymore.

Remeron was suggested in treatment since I’ve suffered with anxiety/social anxiety/major depression for so many years that I had lost hope in ever getting better. Remeron worked fast and with counseling/meditation/exercise, and I felt like a person again. I was on Remeron for about 4 months until I tapered off my 7.5 mg dose. For me less was more. About 10 months later I noticed my depression creeping up and since I’ve been sober/clean for about 15 months I felt like I fell short in mental health maintenance  (when I really didn’t) So I went to see a doctor and got back on 15mg and the next day the medication was already working better than I could have ever hoped for. I didn’t want to accept the fact that I was getting depressed but if I didn’t reach out for help it would of led me down the road to relapse.",0,61,1
"Mirtazapine","Noel Garnet","March 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I've taken Mirtazapine (30 mg) in the orodispersible version for severe depression with insomnia and other disorders. This medication really helped me out, it has litterally saved me. I'm a whole different person after the cure with it. No side effects on me. I recommend taking it in the evening if possible, because this antidepressant has very strong antihistamine properties (I no longer had allergic rhinitis or urticaria from pollen and dust), so it leads to a marked sleepiness. For this reason, it is useful in case of insomnia. My overall opinion is excellent, it pulled me out of a very bad situation of inner suffering that I thought was unfortunately chronic over time. I have not had any withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation. This antidepressant does not affect nor the sexual drive nor the sexual function.",10,46,1

Minor side effects - sluggishness, major weigh gain. I was prescribed this medication due to having poor sleep but it made me have vivid awful dreams - sleep paralysis multiple times a night. I used to sleep for 14+ hours, usually in the day due to being worried about falling asleep for the nightmares. It caused me to miss lots of university - I was so tired and drowsy I could not physically get up. I wish I had been able to understand the effect it was having on my body and stop them sooner. I was severely suicidal. I made plans almost daily, even walking to the shop I thought about walking in front of buses. It was a truly awful time in my life, made worse by a medication which did not suit me. I’m glad it has worked for some, but If anyone I knew personally were to tell me they were taking it, I would advise them not to.",0,34,1

I only took it one night so far and it didn’t work at all for sleep &amp; gave me a headache.  I’m not giving it a rating because I believe the reason for it not working is the brand.

It seems to be helping, although I’m not sure if that’s due to the drug itself or compensatory lifestyle changes - those being forcing myself to eat better and exercise. It seems to have helped my anxiety greatly. I’ve gained 5-10 pounds and my nightmares seem to be more common although that may be due to being in a bad headspace hence needing to take the drug in the first place. I don’t know. Sertraline was awful for me and gave me hypomanic episodes along with emotional blunting and increased anger. I think I’m more irritable on this too although I don’t know. I just want to feel normal again. This seems to be helping somewhat",8,12,1

As I raised my dosage I had side effects that the doctor said would not go away if I continued so I had to stop it. I can also tell you that doctors seem to think this a drug that is easy to get off of but after 6 weeks and being told I can quit cold turkey it was not pleasant and obvious withdrawal symptoms.

Panic disorder and depression was incredibly debilitating, so I didn't sleep at all since. When I was put on this, I am able to sleep through peacefully every night fully through to each morning. I highly recommend taking this with a snack or food if you have a sensitive stomach as this may cause nausea. First few weeks, had a hard time waking up every morning, irritable for the first few months. I eat more on this medication, but its fine with me.

It has robbed me of my young adult years and made me diabetic. At first it helped with sleep and generalized anxiety, but as it became less effective and the dose increased I became more and more apathetic, unmotivated, lazy, loss of personality, loss of feeling of empathy and affection towards others. It made me okay with sitting around being alone and doing nothing. Now it’s completely pooped out and all I’m left with are the side effects. Tapering down is also a struggle with severe withdrawals. I highly advise people to stick to medications with more of an evidence base- SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines, TCAs, and MAOIs... none of these atypical antipsychotic garbage. Mirtazapine basically is an atypical antipsychotic but without the dopaminergic receptor antagonism. Stay away from this garbage.",1,20,2

It did these things, but eventually I started waking throughout the night. I'm not sure if the mirtazapine stopped working or if it was the effect of one of my other drugs, so my doctor has taken me off of it. Unfortunately he switched me to amitriptyline which has given me terrible acid reflux. I don't feel that mirtazapine did much for my depression, but for sleep and appetite it was good.

I slowly decreased the dose of Venl. to 75mg and added 15mg Mirtazapine, so I'm taking both now. Within few days my state has quickly improved and the only side effects I felt was increased sleepiness and appetite. I slept about 9 hours per day but during the day I wasn't sleepier more than usual. Sleeping improvement was quite advantage for me because I had suffered from insomnia before. I'm young and I do sport a lot so I managed not to gain any weight on this medication. Other benefit of this drug for me is that it's a strong antihistamine so it improved also my allergy.

As well as this, during my low points I would be completely put off of food: mirtazapine has increased my appetite massively which is a big bonus as I am dramatically underweight. This drug has made me feel drowsy in the mornings and cloudy thoughts at times but so far it seems to be working. I absolutely would not recommend drinking whilst taking this drug as I had a recent bad experience where I had lost control over my arms legs, vision etc. As far as my work productivity, this drug has been wonders and I am feeling more confident, more relaxed and levelled. I still have low moments but they are more controlled, rather that than uncontrollable depressive states. I would rate it higher but I have to see the full effects of mirtazapine.",7,11,7

However, after talking with my husband, we agreed that taking it at night as prescribed will give me the best results. I started 2 nights ago with my evening dose. I took it earlier in the evening around 7p. By 11:00p I began to get sleepy. Not a KNOCKED OUT type of sleepy, but a good sleepy. Since then, I have gotten a full nights sleep and I wake refreshed. I then take my Welburtin 300 XL and I am ready for the day. I haven't notice a lot of daytime sleepiness either. That may be due to the WB. I really feel like this combo is going to do wonders for me.",10,20,10

When we increased the Mirt, I found it harder to fall asleep. and waking up thru out the night. Since, Mirt is known for the sleepiness at lower levels.

The combination has worked wonders for me. Mirtazapine is so unique among the antidepressants. More sedating than the others, but a tolerance develops over time so that this groggy side-effect becomes more tolerable. My favorite thing about mirtazapine is the elaborate dreams I have, especially when taken with effexor. It regulates a lot of my life, including appetite, sleep, and sexual function (all positively). One odd thing is, these medications seem to blur the line between the dream world and reality. They also have the power to change a person, and are somewhat addictive when used long-term.

I was put on this medicine in 2002 after my daughter was born. To save all the details my physical and mental health went out to rest somewhere leaving me in a body and mind that didn't belong to me. They tried me on every medicine available and nothing worked. The negative long term of this has been: weight gain, dizzy sometimes, dehydration and laziness. The positive is it gave me my life back. I like others here have found it's notorious for appetite. I could eat sugar right out of the bowl. I have had to make myself be more disciplined in my eating and exercise. I combat dehydration by keeping a cup of water with ice in it filled and drink on it all during the day. I am also moving into menopause so have to be very careful. I've heard some talk about the nightmares. Yep, have them too but only if I eat sugar before bed. Lay off the food 4 hours before you go to bed and it will get rid of those monsters under your bed. I have post traumatic stress disorder and that causes most of my nightmares. Still my sleep is awesome. I still have some anxiety from time to time but use Klonopin 0.5 to cut the edge off only when needed. I tried going off about 5 years ago and after about 3 days I couldn't sleep, think, or operate at any type of normalcy. I will have to add I also gained a concentration level I never had before.

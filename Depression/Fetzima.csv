"Fetzima","E","March 31, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I started fetzima in the middle of January 2020 it is now March. Unfortunately it isn’t doing much in helping my anxiety, my obsessive thoughts. It has helped me from feeling destitute. My energy is up. I think it has less side effects than other SSRIs and SNRI. About my obsessive thoughts - I think about things that upset me in the past. I did do this before I wasn’t on anything but I feel like I do it more often then I use to. Also  I read these reviews and see people were in  rage  on this medication - pretty scary. So now I’m thinking I’m like that too lol. I try my best to remember that everything will be okay. Something that has helped ..it seems.. is I take a break of it for a day. Next day I seem to have better clarity. Make sure to advocate for yourself for what’s best for you. They tell you to try different medications I haven’t found much  difference in most of them. Good luck to  you - love",5,7,1
"Fetzima","TLC","February 22, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was taken off my other medications to see if this one would be more effective. I started with the 20mg for 2 days I did feel crummy but I was also taken off the other meds cold turkey so I figured it was from that. Day 3 I started the 40mg and within 30 minutes I just started to feel unwell then got this horrible pressure in my neck and head that continued to get worse. I also became nauseated, shaky, and weak. I called my PCP and she told me that I should probably go to the ER. When I arrived my blood pressure was 184/124 which is normally 100/60. I felt horrible. I was informed that I had a very bad adverse reaction to this medication and should stop immediately. It is 5 days later and my blood pressure is now normal but not 100 percent. This was just my experience, I know that this medication does work well for others and I hope it does that for you, no one deserves to live with depression, anxiety and etc.. it's horrible and I hope you find something that works!!",1,6,1

"Fetzima","RMH","August 27, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","It's helping me get through a difficult patch in life. But I thought I had emotional feelings on  Fetzima, at first, now I feel like I have none, really, except for my cats.  And I'm only taking 10mg, which is opening up a 20mg capsule and taking 1/2 the beads.  This stuff should come in a smaller dose like this for chemically sensitive people.  So it's OK, but long term I'll probably end up switching to something else.",6,6,1
"Fetzima","Anonymousmeds27","August 25, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Where do I begin? I’ve exhausted almost all of my options for approved antidepressants in Canada, with my fair share of negative &amp; positive experiences. Fetzima is the 2nd worst I’ve ever taken, right above Moclobemide. After only a couple days, I had the worst headache of my life, felt like my brain was in a hydraulic press, couldn’t even open my eyes. This lasted 4 more days until I stopped taking this medication. I experienced nausea, but not as bad as some other reviews state. I experienced the body tingling, although this wasn’t too bothersome. I experienced heart palpitations accompanied by chest pain. There is a disabling brain fog that comes with this medication, it certainly numbs your severe emotions, but leaves you with a miserable feeling of apathetic melancholy. I also experienced ear popping &amp; severe sinus irritation, although I’m unsure if this was related to the medication. Not even close to being worth a try for me, but everyone is different.",1,6,1
"Fetzima","Anxiousgirly","August 13, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Fetzima is ruining my life. Its like poison. After being on Paxil for 4 years. I weaned off it with Dr’s direction. After withdrawal were so awful my Dr put me on Fetzima. First 2 weeks I experienced all day gut rot. Dr said that wasn't Fetzima causing it. Week 3 &amp; 4 were pure torture. From vomiting daily, diarrhea, crying nonstop, fits of rage, chest heaviness, lost 12 lbs. Cant eat, feel like I'm loosing my mind. After 30 days I stopped these meds cold turkey. I'd rather suffer with GAD then live on these kinds of meds. Never been so sick. Haven't been able to work. In my opinion Fetzima is garbage.....",1,10,1
"Fetzima","Vk","August 4, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","By day 4 on Fetzima I was having so much anger and rage it scared me.  Not a common reaction for me.  I was talking extremely fast, reacting to almost anything with anger.  I did research on Fetzima, called my Dr. immediately and changed off Fetzima and back to my previous medication.  It was the most horrible experience.  I've never had a medication affect me in such a terrible way.  I'm doing great being back on my previous medication.  STAY AWAY FROM FETZIMA!!!",1,12,1
"Fetzima","Scott","May 27, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","Tried many antidepressants. SNRI are far superior to all SSRI for my MDD, but at the higher recommended dosages. Effexor XR at 225mg had been the best fairly better than Pristiq and much better than Welbutrin. Won't take Cymbalta or any other hepatic side effects possibilities. Did try in for 6 weeks with no improvement. My insurance covers Fetzima 40mg not much help 80mg vast improvements and 120mg first 2 weeks no difference after that 15 to 20% improvement. Wellbutrin no help. Zoloft importance and no help after 4 weeks so no go. My advice try Effexor XR and don't give up on it until 4 weeks at 225mg. Especially if SSRI aren't working. I had no known side effects at any listed does and been on antidepressants for 17 years",8,10,1
"Fetzima","sum","April 10, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Be careful before deciding to take Fetzima for depression, it is absolutely horrible. Caused me severe vomiting almost every day. The worst part was the way it messed with my brain chemistry. Making me angry, confused, and having severe mood swings. It’s been almost 2 years since I’ve been off this medication and still look back on this medication as a real nightmare. It REALLY makes things worse. DON'T TAKE IT.",1,9,1

Then attack either gallbladder or something else?  Severe vomiting.  Did fetzima trigger gastrointestinal problems?  Hasn’t improved mood either.  Going off.  What to try next?  This is a crazy circle.  Hopefully one day there will be something better than  try this,  try that  approach.  At 70, ready to give up.",1,23,1
"Fetzima","Getting There","December 20, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","My depression started when I was 13. I tried countless medications with unpleasant side effects with my PCP and then my psychiatrist and nothing relieved my symptoms entirely. I was seriously considering ECT until he gave me some free samples of Fetzima, when I was about 18 and in my first year of college. I cannot describe to you how much of a difference there was but I will try. This medication quite literally saved my life, as I was suicidal pretty much daily in high school. It was much easier to think, sort my feelings out &amp; continue on with my life after about a month at the highest dose (120mg). Though I am still on Wellbutrin and Adderall XR (since age 15/16), this medication lifted my mood immensely and gave me the hope I needed that life will turn out OK. It's expensive since it's newer, insurance partially covered it.",10,28,1

Horrible vomiting a few hours after first 20 mg. Pharmacy says try Gravol with it.  Tried it for 12 days, had Chills; my extremities are frozen, feet, nose and hands like blocks of ice.  Nausea is debilitating, I felt exhausted 24/7. So I stopped for 5 days to allow the nausea to go away. Tried again after 5 days of break. Day one okay, days 2, 3, 4, and 5 the nausea is back and overwhelming. As soon as I try to get mobile the nausea sets in. Sleep is non existent. I don’t think this drug is for me.

Fetzima is NOT FOR ME, as side effects thus far include insomnia, major mood swings, uncontrollable crying over ???, tingling of body, heart pounding, muscle aches and redness of eyes, eyelids and skin around eyes. Using my facial lotions—which never bothered me pre-Fetzima—results in a burning sensation on skin. I also have constant ringing in ears, head rushes, and pre-seizure-like auras (I’ve had a few med-related seizures in the past). Feel angry and irritated like never before. I yelled at another driver (not that he could hear or see me), calling him an ** idiot. I rarely swear so this was quite a sign of  me not being me.  THAT SAID, I’m going to speak w/MD and cease further Fetzima intake pronto.",1,12,1

"Fetzima","JamJamN8946","February 8, 2018","-","I was switched from anxiety medication to Fetzima. I was very nervous at first, not knowing what to expect and reading a million different reviews.  From my personal experience, this medication has been amazing. I have been feeling so well. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed Christmas instead of stressing myself out beyond belief. I actually feel like I can cope with family, work and life stresses. I tend to overextend myself and try to go above and beyond for holidays, Birthday ‘s, school functions, etc. I can handle it now without having a breakdown and I know my limitations and have learned it’s ok to reach out to others for help. Medicine reacts differently with everyone but I personally have had such a wonderful experience and am so glad I listened to my doctor and tried this. It has been a success for me.",9,28,1

"Fetzima","Keep Going","November 15, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I struggled with symptoms of depression/anxiety since childhood, something that was the result of a naturally sensitive disposition, family history and a history of bullying and self-worth issues.  I took this medication for 2 years and it was the only one that I could tolerate well that worked. I had previously been on Lexapro, Prozac, Cymbalta, and Wellbutrin, which I had to discontinue due to seizures, though it was effective.  This medication, along with psychotherapy and a lot of work put into rebuilding a social network, helped me recover from very persistent depression. I still struggle with anxiety from time to time but it's nothing major. It gave me the momentum to keep going during a very challenging period of my life.",10,19,1

The pain would be significant enough to make it hard to sleep at times. This is in addition to the sexual dysfunction, shivers, gastrointestinal problems, and probably other insignificant side-effects. This medicine was garbage for me. After 24 hours off the medication, all side effects subside, thank goodness. And on top of all these side effects, it did nothing for my depression.",0,9,1

"Fetzima","Anonymous","June 13, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was surprised to see that there were some reviews that showed it wasn't helping some people. I'm very sorry for that. Depression runs in my family. I've been on over 20 different antidepressants throughout my life. Nothing has ever worked. I don't recall any improvement from anything. I started fetzima about 2 years ago. I felt relief within 1 week. I couldn't believe the difference within 2 weeks. I have experienced some rough times. I've had a few suicide attempts and woke up in ICU 3 times. I'm not trying to say I've had it worse than anyone. I'm just saying that was the place I was in. This was the only med that worked. The only drawback is the cost. It's very expensive without a savings card.",10,38,2

Past year my depression/PTSD being managed by Cipralex 20mg. Unhappy with weight gain and anorgasmia so I was just prescribed Fetzima. Weaned off the Cipralex and yesterday was the first day of introduction of Fetzima (20mg) but within hours I developed urinary urgency and much reduced flow. Discomfort increased through the day causing pain and extreme gas/stomach bloating. So 24 hours later I'm not taking Fetzima again until I talk to the doctor. It may just be coincidental but I fear the side effect of urinary retention is a real problem with the Fetzima when exacerbated by a pre-existing BPH condition so beware!",1,16,2
"Fetzima","Wish I could take this one!!","February 21, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","So this drug was awesome for everything except it made me rage full.  I could orgasm, no sleepiness, felt a little nausea but all meds have yucky side effects that go away after a while.  It helped with concentration and motivation!!  Wow I was a super star at work.  Or maybe I was so used to the others SSRI's that gave me brain fog!  I could jump out of bed with no problem in the morning which I never would get before.  But it made me snappy, angry, mad and boil my blood!  It didn't do well for anxiety.  I think it gave me more.  This drug must have a stimulant in it, more than one of the other ones that are more sedating.  It was also the top highest tier for cost!  Too much right now bc its a newer drug.  Doesn't work for anxiety!",7,26,2
"Fetzima","Anonymous","January 27, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Update: I've been on Fetzima 5 months. It has worked better than any of the other 30 meds I've tried. It took 4 months for my arms itching side effect to go away and soreness of my mouth's upper roof and upper gums also is gone. My heat and sweating is almost all gone. If I stay on the couch, I'd have no sweating but when I did anything such as brushing my teeth I'd get so much sweating. Normally I don't sweat. These side effects do go away, so don't give up on this drug too soon. I don't get that drugged out tired feeling from the depression anymore. I do have a little anxiety from Fetzima but it is usually when I'm in bed trying to sleep more when really I had enough sleep which is good because that keeps me from escaping into bed.",10,37,2

I did well on Wellbutrin many years, it stopped working, etc. With Fetzima I get up easily in the morning because I lay in bed for at least 15 minutes, I pet and play with my cat, have quiet time saying things I'm grateful for and sometimes I get guidance for information for my day. I don't overeat anymore, I get full fast, can only eat 1/2 as much as I used to because I get bloated which helps. My headaches went away after 2 months and my sweating is almost gone away now after 3 months. I feel good and motivated to do things. I'm not hyper like with Wellbutrin.",8,37,2

I was at 40 mg, but I'm finding that I am having to titrate, because I just can't take the effects of the nausea.   I'm trying to stick it out, perhaps go down to 20 mg a day and see where I'm at at this point.   I've also tried many medications, and I'm feeling extremely frustrated and somewhat hopeless.

I also have increased sex drive and zero cravings, hence, inevitable weight loss. 40mg is the only dose I have taken, so my experience might be different if dose was higher or lower. This drug reminds me of Wellbutrin (which is NDRI), but slightly less stimulating.  Cons: still brand name only, so can be expensive depending on where you live and insurance situation. Also, Fetzima is only approved to treat depression, so no improvement in anxiety symptoms. Vistaril helps with this, especially if you or your doctor are hesitant about benzos.",9,28,2

"Fetzima","Ben_Y","August 25, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","My doctor gave me this medicine as a treatment for my depression, I also suffer with anxiety. I tried it for a few days and I have to say the side effects really beat me up. I would wake up feeling so crazy and on the second day I had an intense crying/yelling manic anxiety attack. The next day I was laying down feeling relaxed when my heart rate and blood pressure suddenly shot up. I didn't feel anxious or anything it was just my heart rate that shot up it lasted about 30 mins and it was scary to say the least. This drug may be effective for some people but as for me it simply didn't work, maybe if I took it longer but I was risking my heart health. I'm 25 years old I'm to young to be living like someone 3x my age",1,27,3

Couldn't even find the strength or will to get off my grandmothers couch. The doc gave me the first 3 weeks dosage (2 20mg then up to 40). The very first day I noticed changes. I had my energy back, I wanted to do things again. The side effects didn't kick in until day 4. Nausea, constipation, and overall foul stomach. My stomach made noises that I've never before heard it make. It was putting me in such a great mood that I just pushed through it and in about a week, with lots of antacid and stool softener, it subsided. This medicine has helped me tremendously so far in my battle with depression.",6,70,3

I:m not sure if I will stay there or what just yet. The only side effect thus far was about a week of lightheadedness upon rising, which has since subsided. I do believe the depression doesn't feel quit as heavy and the three hours I do sleep were better sounder sleep. I have tried everything there is and this is wook for a whole then side effects outweigh bennifit or just stop working. I am hoping that the seemingly quick response continues. This could be the one. Hopefully the saratonin reuptake adds to it's effectiveness. Waiting to see../",4,27,3

Fortunately I have had beneficial effects from several over the years.  The most effective treatment to date has been a combination of Wellbutrin and Cymbalta. I took that combination for ten+ years and unfortunately I recently started slipping downward, increased depression and feeling out of control.  I  was prescribed Fetzima (transitioned off Cymbalta) and completed the starter pack with the only benefit being increased energy. My Dr then increased the doseage to 80mg and have been at 80mg for two + weeks.  I have never felt (for lack of a better word) so crazy in my life! I have been so irretiable, angry, depressed and unreasonable and feeling",1,43,3

My overall mood and ability to concentrate is much improved but the side effects are bothersome.  One side effect not mentioned here is what I am guessing is an hormonal imbalance.  My nipples are sensitive and swollen (I am a 58 yo male) and have  outbreaks of acne mostly on my neck area.  My blood pressure went for normal to hypertension stage one.  Increased headaches (not migraine quality) and blurred vision.  Fits of anger/irritated feelings especially when driving.

"Fetzima","Anonymous","May 15, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","25, Male. I noticed the previous reviewer mentioned having ocular symptoms with Fetzima. I’ve also been having these issues. Specifically, I’ve had eye pain, a feeling of pressure behind the eyes and a tight feeling as if my eyes are about to pop out of my head. Other than the previous reviewer, I haven’t seen anyone else mention it, and it doesn’t seem to be an acknowledged side effect in the literature. I’ve had a number of other side effects, but they are manageable; this one is most troubling. I’ve been on the drug 3 months and I would have already quit except it’s the only drug (of many I’ve tried) that has helped my energy, focus and motivation. I will probably see an ophthalmologist before I decide whether to discontinue.",5,54,3

I've noticed improvement of my mood and general outlook, and have experienced some of the typical and more minor side effects, but the ocular symptoms are most worrisome.  After about a month on this med, my lower right eye lid began twitching intermittently.  It does so on a regular basis, and now I am experiencing a strange tightening in my eyes and blurred vision.  It flares up randomly, and generally my eyes now feel like they're too big for their sockets.  Progressive worsening concerns me as does permanent damage to my eyes.  My doctor recommended a daily dosage of Magnesium and increased water intake.  Unsure if I should continue to try and stabilize the symptoms, or stop all together!",7,39,3

However, did help me see reality a bit clearer and begin to feel good emotoons again. Sadly had to get off of it because it caused an allergic reaction after four days with hives and itching.

My mood is significantly better and I have more energy.  Most importantly it has lifted my need for other mood altering medicines.  I have been sober for four months without really trying.  Amazingly I no longer feel the need to escape reality.  I hope and pray it continues to work as it's given me a glimpse of what life without addiction and depression can be.  It's been life changing.   As for side effects I have noticed an increase in irritability.  I have had inconsistencies in the bedroom as well.  Sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Overall well worth it for me!",9,107,3
"Fetzima","WeeBeastie","January 22, 2015","-","Have been on many antidepressants, most either not effective enough or side effects were too much. I am on 40mg in 3rd month. On the   side I have much more energy, I am no longer sleeping excessively, my anger/irritability is much less. Most important, my depression is much better and emotionally I feel much better. Now, Started getting headaches, severe ones, that only responded to ice packs. Then my blood pressure went way way up. The headaches are probably related to the elevated blood pressure. I also got the sweats (at first I thought it was menopause, but not so).  I was also having a hard time sleeping. Finally heart racing. Will try a bit longer to see if body can adapt to it, because my mood is much better, but worried regarding side effects.",7,76,3

The comment above me was almost like a mirror image! I was so relieved to see that another person has been on every anti-depressant out there and none had really worked... For me however, all the anti-depressants I have been on in the past have actually caused an opposite effect than what they are meant to do. I would become even more depressed and even suicidal. I have Systemic Lupus, (among many other serious health issues) and in my case, the Lupus is very severe. It is pain, every waking moment. The Fetzima 40mg has helped a bit with that, it hasn't made me more depressed and I think I may even be feeling a bit more positive. So, all in all, I think it may be working : )",5,98,3

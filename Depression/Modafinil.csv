"Modafinil","Johnny","March 11, 2020","-","Have been taking modafinil now for a month to help my depression and just progressed from a starting dose of 100 mg/d to 200mg. So far I have found it to be very good. I’m 65 and for the past couple of years I had been very apathetic about whether or not I went to work. Small tasks in life, to say nothing of some if the less pleasurable  tasks at work, seemed overwhelming, so I would simply not do then, but not anymore. Interactions with superiors are a lot smoother.  My psychiatrist initially prescribed modafinil a a drug to help this stop using cocaine,  and it is working. When I saw him the other I said, where has this medicine been all my life? So far all effects seem positive. At least for me. Used online coupons to get a month’s supply for ~$25. However prices vary widely eve. With coupons  by pharmacy, from the price I pay to several hundred dollars a month. Otherwise my insurance wouldn’t cover it, even if my psychiatrist had listed an  on-label  need for it",10,5,1
"Modafinil","kkheflin3","February 15, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","After 3 months I quit taking Zoloft for depression after taking Modafinil. It gives me energy from chronic fatigue also. I'm a teacher and I also notice I'm much more alert and focused while taking it. I have mild bipolar 1 also and take Seroquel and Lamictal also. I can't detect any side effects unless I have to take it with my asthma inhaler as then it can cause shakiness, nervousness, sleeplessness, etc. Otherwise it's a great product! I found Zoloft to numb me to a degree--I didn't feel sad but I didn't feel happy either. Kind of desensitized.",10,7,1
"Modafinil","RFM","February 7, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I take modafinil on and off for OCD &amp; Depression and it works.

I developed severe apnea and was prescribed modafinil.  Totally unintended but my depression started to subside. Unfortunately,  it doesn't stay away if I stop taking modafinil.  I asked my psychiatrist to prescribe it for me. He would not. My debate was this, I had taken every single drug cocktail thrown at me for years and years. I never blinked.  I complied. Now I find something that works and I can't have it? Put me in a study. I'll do whatever it takes, I said. I'm telling you I have my life back. I can feel happy and hopeful again.

"Modafinil","Coop","July 29, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","For me it's impressive! After my Burnout and the following depression, it was a struggle for me, that I wasn't able to bring the past performance. Lack of energy and concentration, mood swings, bad memory, and so on. With Modafinil I am able to work focused on my dream, fight procrastination (which was a real problem), think-power from past days (I often gave up when I had so solve something complex) I don't take it every day, sometimes only 1-2 days a week. Mostly when I'm working on my project or when I feel really bad. Side Effects: Headache during effect-phase (when I started, but was gone after the third intake) Insomnia (when you take it too late)",9,30,1

"Modafinil","better_now","January 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have struggled with major depression since I was 13 (I'm 23 now).  I have been put trough the ringer of all the traditional antidepressant classes.  I've tried two SSRI's, three SNRI's, several different atypical antipsychotics, Remeron,  Lamictal, and Wellbutrin XL.  I'm a man and have had terrible sexual side effects with antidepressants.  Recently I was diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, and I said I need something new. My psychiatrist suggested Provigil, since it is less likely than other stimulants to worsen high blood pressure.  It has been a godsend for my depression.  I have energy, intense focus and have been doing much better in my college courses.  Long work shifts that used to drag on forever now seem to fly by.  I am more patient and outgoing than I have ever been.  Now I just take this and Wellbutrin XL.  Definitely recommend.  Should be used much more frequently for refractory depression. It's not covered on insurance but I can get it for like $40 per month.",9,23,1
"Modafinil","bluebird","October 16, 2018","-","I started taking Provigil for major depression. I cannot take SSRI's so the doctor put me on 450 mg of Wellbutrin. When I took my first Provigil, I was so tired and could not think well. It was tired like one might feel if they had taken a huge overdose of Benadryl. Not a good tired at all. I do not feel like doing anything. I am also diagnosed with anhedonia and PTSD.   The main idea I want to get across is that on the day I took the Provigil and felt so horrible about twelve hours later I had a two-hour window of feeling normal I did not feel depressed at all and I actually wanted to play solitaire. I cannot tell you what a huge difference this was as my natural state is being in so deep a depression it is hard to make it from one moment to the next.  I want so badly to feel like I did in that two-hour window and I want to know if it was the Provigil that caused it. I also wonder If I should quit taking Wellbutrin because maybe together it is just too much.",7,11,1

I can think faster and more clearly (no more brain fog), my depression is non-existent, and I have a tremendous boost of energy! The only side effect has been heart palpitations in the afternoon.  I've read this goes away after about a week. Not bothersome enough to stop. My insurance wouldn't cover the cost to use it for depression. With an online coupon I was able to get it for under $70. All other pharmacies were between $115 and $600 for a month supply! And those prices are for the generic with coupon. Cash prices for brand name was a little over $1,000!",9,21,1

My head is crystal clear, no confusion, no negative feelings or procrastination. After about 3 hours of taking the medication I had my whole day planned out and was able to complete each and every task with ease. I am 50 years old and up until today had spent most of my life unable to complete the simplest of tasks. I would just spend my time thinking about the task and waste away the time, to sum up my life to this point has been full of promises and unfulfilled potential. But after my first day on modafinil I feel that my life has just begun. I pray that the effects of modafinil do not diminish. I have decided to keep a video diary of my journey on youtube",10,46,1

After experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness, my doctor prescribed Modafinil 300. Not only has it CURED any notion of sleepiness during the day, but it has augmented my other medications 2-fold! I don't know what it would or would not do as a monotherepy, but it has helped tremendously and I am now asymptomatic. Additionally, it has increased my cognitive function - directly or indirectly - such that I scored 12 points higher than previous on a standardized IQ test. I am now a member of Mensa. These are anecdotal, subjective observations to be sure, but I am convinced of its efficacy for multiple issues.",10,33,1
"Modafinil","Ash10105","March 6, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Highly rate this medicine. It's not an anti-depressant but with depression comes a lot of sleepiness which this is great for. Also the AD's often cause sleepiness. Modafinil does what it says it does. It keeps you awake/alert and combats AD induced fatigue/tiredness. I'd question if it makes you 'smarter'. For me (83kg, male, 27 YO) at 100mg it is a mild keep me awake. At 150 it's perfect. At 200mg it's stimulating, alerting and induces mild hypomania (Which is okay but I feel slightly too 'buzzed' at 200mg). No bothersome side effects experienced other than mild hypomania which is sometimes pleasant and not too alarming. NOTE - I am prone to anxiety but this did not increase anxiety levels for me.

Even when I was in a bad bout of depression I could still work. That's never happened before. What I didn't realise was that it was actually keeping my depression at bay. I found out because the factory that makes all the 'Provigil' for my entire country shut down so I had to stop taking it. My doctor has put me on a large dose of Ritalin and there is absolutely comparison. I am currently in the worst bout of depression I've had in ages. It's taking all I've got just to handle my immediate deadlines. I am feeling the Modafinil's absence, acutely. Other drug info: I am also taking a combination of Welbutrin and St. John's Wort.

Sleeping or laying in bed for 16 hours was normal for me. I was on 200mg each morning in combination with anti-depressants and a sleeping pill at night. I noticed no side effects from modafinil. I am no longer on this medication because it did not help with my depression, just helped with a symptom of my depression. (low energy).

"Modafinil","Depression diagnosed in 1965","June 24, 2015","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Since diagnosis I have been on almost every medication that has been introduced.  For the last five years I have taken 300mg Bupropion,  300mg Gabapentin 3/day, 200mg Modafinil, and additionally, Xanax, as needed.  The Bupropion alone was not helping somatic symptoms and the Gabapentin solved that.  The added Modafinil caused no noticeable side effects.   It did provide increased energy, a more positive mood, emotional stability, and a feeling of cheerfulness which was foreign to me. It does not prevent a good afternoon nap when needed and has never interfered with sleep at night. As I told my physician,  The bupropion keeps me from wanting to die and the modafinil makes me want to live,  Any minor side effects would be worth the benefits",10,77,2

This may have messed with the Provigil to the degree that it may have messed with my system.  I think this entry is valuable.  Benzodiazepines do not appear to be useful in combination with Provigil or Modafinil.  Days when I did not take Benzodiazepines the following days were pretty normal.  The important entry I want to contribute is to say that the days following a Provigil day were the ones that were the most productive.  I was far more on after the drug wore off.

"Modafinil","Anonymous","June 4, 2009","-","<b>Provigil (modafinil):</b>			 This turned me from a deep, suicidal depression into a happy, productive person in 2 days. I am also able to sleep without any sleep medicines (first time in years). My problem is that my insurance refuses to pay for it because using Provigil for depression/bipolar is off-label, and it is so expensive that I'm just starting to wean myself off of it, sadly.  There is another drug, Nuvigil that is supposed to be even better, and is currently being tested (very positive results so far) for FDA approval in the use of it for depression and bipolar.  It's been a long road for me, so I can only pray that the FDA moves quickly on this.",0,130,3
"Modafinil","jaguiar","May 20, 2009","-","<b>Provigil (modafinil):</b>			 This is a WONDER DRUG in the use of depression. I have suffered for years with depression and never with any relief from the mainstream anti-depressants. Either the side effects were intolerable, or the medicine just didn't work. Within 3 days of taking Provigil, I was the happiest, most productive I had been in a year. The first 2 days I was still really sleepy, and the 3rd day, a little hyper, but after that day I have felt EXCELLENT. I don't have anxiety attacks anymore and I get a full night of good sleep and wake up feeling extremely refreshed and I am happy again. I was on my couch for a straight 6 months sleeping and crying until I started this medicine. It literally saved my life.",0,298,3

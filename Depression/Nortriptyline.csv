"Nortriptyline","Flutter","May 16, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I had literally tried every SSRI and SNRI out there... 7 years of going through my nightmare of a life and nothing worked for my Treatment Resistant Depression. I was honestly considering ECT... I asked my psychiatrist if we could try a tricyclic in a last ditch effort... he put me on Nortriptyline a year ago. I'm now up to 100mg at bedtime, but this antidepressant has helped me more than anything had in 7 years, and no weight gain or bad side effects for me.",10,8,1
"Nortriptyline","Eric G","April 21, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was getting ECT treatment for depression when my doctor told me Nortriptyline pairs well with the ECT therapy. I once had a bad reaction to Trintillex . Without having much recollection of why I decided to start this new med I did. I felt ECT was starting to heal my depression. As a few weeks passed,  I noticed major daytime fatigue. Also EVERY night I would experience irrational fear and panic, also had a few panic attacks at night which has not happened for me in years. Constipation , vomiting , worsening depression, thoughts of self harm . It took me way too long to figure out nortriptyline was the culprit of all this. I was on this medicine for about two months and am in the process of weaning off. If you notice similar symptoms speak up to your doctor ASAP.",1,3,1
"Nortriptyline","Cml","March 31, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I was put on Nortriptyline for my depression and anxiety, but up to now it did not help yet. The only thing it does help with is sleep, 30 minutes after my dose I get extremely tired and get knocked out, and after 10 hours of deep sleep I wake up still very tired. Also very hard to get orgasm which is a frustrating side effect. Which I never experienced with any SSRI. Phenelzine also has this side effect but less than Nortriptyline If it wont give me any relief in 2 weeks for my depression and anxiety my doctor will put back to Nardil / Phenelzine 90mg, This has very few side effects and at least gives decent positive effect.",3,4,1

My doctor added 75 mg of nortriptyline every day and I swear I felt major relief in just 3 days. I have been on the Trintellix/Pamelor combo now for over a year. No side effects, and the Pamelor is cheap. As an added bonus, I have chronic hip pain due to bursitis and the pain has almost completely gone away. I am so thankful for this medicine, it has truly helped me.",0,18,1
"Nortriptyline","PH","February 16, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I have been on nortriptyline for 2.5 years due to anxiety and it has significantly improved my quality of life.  I do have dry mouth as a side effect but it is very worth it in comparison to the benefits that it brings. Prior to starting nortriptyline I experienced a number of secondary symptoms caused by my anxiety:  insomnia,  headaches, and loss of appetite.   In addition to reducing my anxiety, I now sleep well every night,  no longer have frequent headaches, and I have an appetite that allows me to keep my weight at a healthy spot (I was too thin before).   These things seem to help my immune system too because I seem to be much better at fighting off/avoiding colds than before I was on this medication. So in summary:  This medication helped address my anxiety and a bunch of secondary symptoms that I hadn’t realized were anxiety related.  On this medication I feel happier and healthier than ever before.",10,15,1

"Nortriptyline","TCA Enthusiast","November 17, 2019","-","This was super-effective for both severe treatment resistant depression, anxiety, chronic vestibular migraines, panic attacks and even helped a bit with social anxiety and OCD. Never had such remarkable effects from any other drug before, even with SSRIs/SNRIs(which made depression worse) and MAOIs. I started feeling better the very first day and within a few days I had old emotions back that I hadn't experienced in years. Unfortunately I developed a drug allergy to this drug, but it is not the drug's fault but my immune system. The drug still gets a 10/10, and I will be trying another TCA soon hoping it works just as well! Also don't worry about the anticholinergic effects of this medicine/other TCAs the anticholinergic side-effects of this medicine can actually be of benefit in treating your depression and should rather be called effects than side-effects and embraced and accepted as being potentially positive.",10,23,1
"Nortriptyline","Vothene","August 25, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was hospitalized for depression recently after many hospitalizations. I have tried almost all of SSRIs &amp; the only one that slightly helped was Wellbutrin. It stopped working for me in the last year along with lithium. I was prescribed nortriptyline in hospital starting at 10 mg up to 100 mg. Shortly after the 100 mg I experienced a feeling of being on speed. The surge of rage taking over me and caused so many panic attacks. After a visit to ER it was reduced to 85 mg. After a couple of days on 85 mg of nortriptyline I felt like my old self again.  In disbelief my lack of motivation was gone and I experienced  my old self . So far it has been a week and I feel very good. I hope this lasts as I’ve been experiencing treatment resistant depression for 4 years now. Let’s hope this tricyclics antidepressant is the answer for me.",8,27,1

"Nortriptyline","dordeduh","March 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Nortriptyline is a great medication and is one of the only meds that don't numb my emotions completely. In fact, I noticed I was more attuned to things like tv shows and books rather than feeling completely apathetic. You really should get your genes/SNPs tested before you take this to make sure you're a normal metabolizer; if not, it may not work for you at all (ultrarapid metabolizer) or you could have too many side effects (poor metabolizer). If you're doctor is worth his/her salt, he will also take a blood level of nortriptyline to determine you're within the therapeutic window for optimal effects. I highly recommend this medication as a first or second choice after SSRIs even though it didn't quite work out for me because it made a preexisting health condition worse. It's also very cheap.",8,12,1

Therapy had been helpful but there was a marked improvement in both conditions after I began this drug. Primarily, I am more able to let things go when I am distressed instead of compulsively fixating on them. My quality of life is so much better now. I initially had some light-headedness. This side effect went away within a few months. I have a bit of dry mouth and I believe I suffered some hair loss. I was most troubled by the hair loss because I am pretty vain.

I weaned myself off at one point for fear that I was having a bad side effect. I had forgotten how much pain relief it provided until I was off of it. This is one of the most helpful medications I've ever taken! It helps with pain, dysautonomia and depression! I don't think it gives me bad side effects.

Initially, it took about 4 weeks before I started feeling the effects of the drug, but once it kicked in it made all the difference in the world. After many years, my doctor had me try some of the newer SSRI drugs (while still on Nortriptyline) and with each one I didn't feel at all like myself (like I was watching my life from outside myself), so with each attempt at trying a new drug, I kept going back to what worked best.

I felt like a zombie at first for maybe 3 days but then it went away.  In 6 weeks my depression was gone and I felt like a normal person.  I was normal.  I think my does at one point was 100 which is moderate.  People need to know that this type of med takes 6-8 weeks to work and when it does its like a fog has lifted, for me at least.

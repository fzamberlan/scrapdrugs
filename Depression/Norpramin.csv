"Norpramin","Joanzie","November 15, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I took this drug for over 20 years.  It worked extremely well for me.  Dry mouth was my only side effect.  I was told by my pharmacy they could no longer get it.  I took the generic for a while but it never worked as well.  I was surprised to read others have taken it recently.  How sad something that worked so well for many is hard to get.  I would switch back in a heartbeat.",10,19,1
"Norpramin","1122334455","April 3, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I did so well on this medication!  But I can no longer afford it. The generic version I was paying $280 a month. I have since changed to Effexor, and now on Zoloft and neither one works as well.  I had been on this since 1986, but had to change last November because of the cost. I miss it so much",10,23,1
"Norpramin","JenniferRose","January 21, 2014","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I have spent years going through one anti-depressant after another.  I even did ECT treatments and nothing worked.  My psychiatrist then put me on desipramine and I have never looked back.  I have energy, I can concentrate, get out of bed, and function for the first time in years.  I've been taking it for 6 months now and have not had to increase the dosage, either.  It was truly a godsend.",10,120,1

"Norpramin","DoktorRowan","January 29, 2013","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Desipramine has worked wonders for me. After many years on and off of various medications that would - at best, if they worked at all - help briefly and degenerate into vicious side effects, this one worked like a charm. The only down-side is that it is so innocuous that it's easy to get used to the improvement; since the improvements it can be tempting to consider oneself better and discontinue prematurely. Fortunately there are no discontinuation effects, and the only side effect I have experienced is slight photosensitivity.",10,87,1

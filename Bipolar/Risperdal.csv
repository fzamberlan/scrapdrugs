"Risperdal","gatinha","May 14, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've tried a lot of different meds, my favorite by far is Lamictal but it stopped working after 10 years. I started risperidone a year ago. It makes me calm, I hardly get angry, I have no anxiety, and I have not had an episode since I started it. I feel great on it in general. The down side -- It makes me lazy, I'm so chill now that I'm totally comfortable just sitting on the couch. I feel relaxed and balanced but without the anxiety I have no reason to get up and run it off. The biggest and worst issue I have with it is the damn weight gain. I've always been super fit and thin but now I have a belly that I just can't get rid of. If the it didn't work so well for my mood I would get off of it immediately to lose my weight. I would still recommend it and I won't be stopping it anytime soon.",8,3,1
"Risperdal","James","December 21, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Risperdal saved my life. I was hospitalized two times with psychosis and this is what they gave me. It took a few weeks to really kick in. At first I was tired. I have been on the med for almost five years now. I am able to live a normal life although I still have some depression. I take 4mg risperdal which I just increased from 3mg because at times I would have mild hallucinations or delusions when tired or the like. They are almost non existent now, really just coming on if I have caffeine. I did gain weight but not meaningfully so. The trick is to watch your calories and exercise as much as possible. I would recommend trying this for severe psychosis. I also take 600mg lithium which seems to help my mood. I like to think that the lithium helps the brain from the damage risperdal can cause. Without risperdal I wouldn't be here by now. Everyday is a blessing and a gift!",9,15,1

"Risperdal","Scott","November 19, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This stuff literally made me feel life wasn't for me anymore, there were the horrendous side effects, the worst being an uncontrollable need to MOVE somehow (Akathisia) and the dark dark dark thoughts. I was switched to  seroquel and then to abilify, but all these gave me the same side effects.",1,11,1
"Risperdal","LS","August 16, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Risperdal was the first medication I ever tried for my bipolar type one and it was awful. They started me out on 8mg which is unusually high, it kept me from being manic or depressed but also completely stopped me from being able to feel any emotion. I was a zombie. I honestly felt like if my best friend died I'd feel absolutely nothing, it was that bad. Would not recommend, my current psychiatrist also says she hates Risperdal if that helps any.",1,21,1
"Risperdal","Nubie","August 9, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I take Resperdal 4 mg with 20 mg celexa. I was on invega sustena before. Since I changed I find that I sing a lot and my mood is sometimes loony sometimes doesn't want to deal with people.  I gained so much weight on both celexa and risperdal around 40lbs. I will talk to my Dr about decreasing the dose and get on a diet.  I hope that will lessen the symptoms.",7,12,1
"Risperdal","sadhadf","July 3, 2019","-","I've been taking this medication for about 9 months and I completely lost myself. I gain 40lbs I feel unmotivated all the time I feel sedated, it is not me anymore. I am a perfectionist and risperdal is definitely the deadliest medication ever for me. I hate taking it but I have no other choice. If another medication works for you just stay away from risperdal it is awful.",2,17,1
"Risperdal","Forabell","July 2, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I took Risperdal for three years for my Bipolar, and it seemed to work really well and that is why I stayed on it for so long but I eventually started to gain weight very rapidly I was 190 lbs (I am a 5'4 female) and I was completely lethargic all the time, I wasn't necessarily depressed but just apathetic and cold. My psychiatrist helped wean me off it (It is not addictive it just causes withdrawal symptoms) and even before I was completely off it I had lost 15 lbs. I am now 40 pounds lighter and its been about two months. My friends and family say my emotions are much more colorful and I seem more emotionally engaged. I know that it has worked for many people though and it helped me a lot when the symptoms started appearing.",6,14,1
"Risperdal","Jello","June 8, 2019","-","Have been taking Risperodal for almost a year now. I tried Seroquel before for some months but it made me super drowsy throughout the day and I couldn’t function. I take Risperdal for severe depression, mania, and extreme hallucinations. I would see cartoons and things appear before me, hear voices/sounds in my ears, or feel things on me for (someone patting my back or grabbing my legs when I’m alone in the room). I started off taking 0.5 mg once a day then upped it to 1mg. Was on 1mg for a while. It worked well for me. I stopped seeing hallucinations and for the most part my mania and depression and lessened or gone away. I woke up every day feeling refreshed. Even my period cramps were usually less painful than before. Everything would go downhill when I decided to stop the medication, all the symptoms would come back quickly and badly. Didn’t gain significant weight from the meds and I’ve had moderate acne. Seems like it’s going to be really hard to leave this medication.",9,19,1
"Risperdal","Jynxette","April 9, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I started taking this few years after I had my son and after some months I started to notice it made me start too  lactate again with chest tenderness  and swelling.  Needless to say I had to stop taking this medication.",0,5,1
"Risperdal","Shereen","March 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","After some months on Risperdal, I developed swallowing problems, which led to anxiety.  Lowering dose  improved but did not eliminate the problem.  Later I noticed that I was very tense all the time.  I would notice it and make myself relax and then in a few seconds I realized I was all tensed up again.  I developed frozen muscles in my forehead.  It felt like they had very little feeling..I don't know what you call it but I saw it was listed as a side effect once I looked it up.  It went away when I stopped the med.  When I stopped this medication, I discovered I had a problem with my tongue.  It is like it's too thick or something and doesn't form words as well, so I have a very mild speech impediment now.  It is more difficult to speak and I have to be very deliberate in speaking in order to speak clearly and without a lisp.",0,19,1
"Risperdal","Cara","February 4, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Overall, I really like risperdal. It's easy to take with minimal side effects. I take the generic version for Bipolar 2 and have been trying over 30 meds for 5 years. I used to take Seroquel and Divlaprox but they stopped working for me and I was too tired. My mood is the most stable I've ever been and I am level headed and clear. I take .5 mg every night and find this is a good dose because I used to take more and was very out of it. This helps me sleep but not be drowsy. Honestly, it's not perfect as I'm dealing with depression currently. I tried prozac but it made me suicidal/dissociate and zombie like and less like myself. Because of this I just recently stopped prozac but I plan to try other antidepressants with this to help my depression. Overall, I love that I mostly feel like myself again. I just want to care about life more now and be less apathetic. DBT therapy helps. Also, acne on my body/face from this but no weight gain so I can't complain too much.",8,12,1
"Risperdal","AJ","January 16, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I took the lowest dose. Once. It caused parkinsonism and extremely slowed movement. I fell down a flight of stairs because of movement problems it caused. Needless to say I never took it again after that.",1,15,1
"Risperdal","DJetts","December 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been on this med for almost two months. I started on a low dose but lately I have had to increase the dose to get the most benefits from it. Initially it will make me tired but my acute mania would return after a couple weeks. Been on 4mg for 3 weeks but have noticed that weight gain has been an issue for me, but I'll just have to watch what I eat and exercise more. Currently jumped to 5mg and willing to give it a try. Not too many side effects like somnolence , anxiety, and fatigue which goes away within two weeks. However, I take other meds so I'm trying to figure out if I need a mood stabilizers or other meds that I'm taking. Just want to feel better and finish my degree as an adult student without the excessive tiredness. But I've on Seroquel before, but I got type 2 diabetes from it. For restlessness I take cogentin and it works great.",8,5,1
"Risperdal","Bsf","September 4, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I suffer from major depressive disorder and ended up in the psychiatric hospital with thoughts of suicide and extremely bad depression. They prescribed me risperdal 2mg I started off at 140lbs since being on the medication I am 230lb almost double my weight and have gained puffy tender breasts. As for the pill working it works 100% at what its suppose to do. If your extremely in need of help and don't care for the side effects go for it.",10,14,1
"Risperdal","Anonymous","August 26, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","At the beginning of taking this medication I was on 0.5mg twice a day. Now my doctor upped it to 1.0mg twice a day...and boy do I feel drowsy all day long! I even took a pregnancy test because I was so tired. But no its the increase in the dosage. If I didn't have 2 young children dependent on me I would have never got out of bed since yesterday. I feel that exhausted. I will go back to the doctor ASAP, I can't walk around like a zombie. I don't know what feeling is worse.",6,7,1
"Risperdal","Cade","May 5, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Works quite well but beware of side effects. I'm an autistic person and also bipolar 1 with psychotic features. Before I started this I had horrible episodes of mania and depression and it made a huge difference. I had almost no maniac episodes, decreased irritability, and it almost completely eliminated the auditory hallucinations. However the weight gain was unbearable, I gained 80 pounds in a year that I still can't lose and diet and exercise did nothing to stop it. I didn't change medications sooner because it worked so well that I was scared to stop it and I was convinced eventually the weight gain would stop, but it didn't. Stopped my monthly cycle completely, though I wasn't complaining about that.",7,10,1

"Risperdal","EllaCB","January 17, 2018","-","I was hospitalized for major depressive disorder and placed on resperidone 1 mg and Celexa to combat depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. My feelings are that resperidone made me feel like a zombie, caused my thinking to be slower and less clear. I put on 50 pounds in the course of 20 months on this medication and that is even with regular exercise. So I do not think resperidone is worth the terrible side effects that it brings. I am now on Zoloft and coming off resperidone completely.",0,6,1

I would like to mention that I have not gain a single pound on this drug.  Always, always, always... take this right before you lay down at night to go to sleep.  Take this pill, then lay down and go to bed.  That way, you will sleep your way through the munchies.  I take it as though it is a sleeping pill and it works for me..

As an answer to Bipolar Disorder with psychotic features this drug works wonders and I have been without relapse for 3 years now. My biggest frustration however is the weight gain. I have put on 8 kg during this time and I eat like a bird. I have tried a number of diets and exercise 3-4 times per week.  My psychiatrist mentioned slightly decreasing the dosage every second day and see if that helps. I will try this as soon as I get a new script with 1mg pills.

"Risperdal","David29303","June 18, 2017","-","I have been taking this medication for about a year.  I started off with 0.5 mg.  I was still having some evening anxiety so I asked to be moved to 1 mg dosage.  I still had occasional anxiety in the evenings, so I asked to be moved to 1-2 mg dosage.  I find that moving up to a 2 mg dosage causes me some drowsy issues and I am currently tweaking it to where I need it. My anxiety is like nothing I have ever seen or heard anyone experience.  I know there are other people out there that have the same issues.  I think it helps stabilize my highs and lows.  I am more a bipolar type 2 person, which means my depressions are slight and my hypo-mania is somewhat great because I feel I can take on the world.",8,13,2

It works wonderful for this for me. My OCD is very much under control taking this in conjunction with Prozac-there are so many things I just could not do and was so afraid of because of the OCD before getting on Prozac and I could do even more after adding Risperdal to it. I take 2 mgs, but I usually take it a few hours before bedtime because it does make me drowsy. I haven't gained weight from it and really haven't had any side effects.",9,23,2

A month after starting this med I started having heart palpitations (I've never had a heart problem) that continued to get worse until I had been to the ER twice, family Dr once, with an appt scheduled with a cardiologist, legitimately thinking something major was wrong. Two dr's suggested that Risperdal could be causing it, so I began tapering. Two weeks later I am completely off the Risperdal, back on Zyprexa and my heart is fine now. Very scary for me.",3,34,2

Pros -Effectively worked -Helped with hypomania -Helped with mania Cons -Developed Hyperprolactinemia -From ^^^ i developed amenorrhea and weight gain -Mental Slowness (things were harder to learn and harder to remember) It's a good medication that worked for me, but I had unfortunate side effects. Everyone is different so don't automatically discount the drug if you are just starting it based on everyone else's experience. It DID work for me the way it was supposed to, but I also had side effects so I had to switch it. I'm giving it 8 out of 10 because it DID manage my BPD well.",8,25,2

"Risperdal","Anonymous","October 11, 2011","-","This medicine was prescribed to me for bipolar disorder, along with irritability problems, serious anger was becoming a problem. I read these reviews after being prescribed and I can honestly say that I was not one who felt its benefits immediately. This medicine takes 3 to 4 weeks to fully affect you. So far the main thing I have noticed is that I feel more balanced, and have not had an over the top anger explosion. This medicine in combination to my others seems to be helping overall. Everyone's own body is a chemistry set, you just have to try things in combination with others and see if it helps.",8,57,3
"Risperdal","Tired of anger","August 24, 2011","-","This medication was not good for me. My Doctor added this to the Depakote I was already taking to help with irritability and aggressiveness. This turned me into a zombie. Walked around in a fog the whole time I was on it. Still irritable and more so because I couldn't focus. Experienced nightmares, anorgasmia. When I could keep an erection and had an orgasm, had no ejaculate. Really scary. Took it for 2 weeks and then stopped taking it. Bad for me. May help someone else.",1,33,3

"Risperdal","Katie19","July 1, 2011","-","Risperdal has helped control my moods and anger so much. I can tell right away if I have missed a dose because I immediately feel agitated. Unfortunately I began lactating and have not gotten my period since I moved up to a higher dose 2 months ago. I also feel rather sluggish during the day but to me the Pros exceed the Cons. Hopefully I will be allowed to stay on this.",8,24,3
"Risperdal","Andres Roman","April 10, 2011","-","I developed cronic insomnia in 2002 in Orlando, FL., as a result, I developed Bi-polar. After many exhausting doctor visits with Physicians and Psychiatrists I got lucky, and was referred to a great doctor who now prescribes me Risperdal. Risperdal relaxes me and puts me to sleep at night. The only side effect that I get is that it makes me a little sluggish in the morning, but overall I sleep 8-9 hrs everyday. I have a new lease on life thanks to Risperdal.",0,37,3
"Risperdal","relieved mom","February 28, 2011","-","My 11 year old started taking this about a month ago and what a difference it has made. He is finally able to control his anger and think more rationally. However he is constantly hungry. All I can do is educate him on good nutrition while on this medicine.",7,26,3
"Risperdal","Bettyjoe","August 8, 2010","-","This pill has been very good to me.  It calms me down and balances out my mood so I no longer have the extreme ups and downs.  It keeps me in a happy middle.  While many other bipolar medicines I have taken have made me feel an inability to feel angry, Risperdal just keeps me from making a huge deal over small issues.  I no longer get mad over petty things, but I do feel angry when something extremely upsetting happens.  I do not feel extreme sadness for no reason any longer, but I do feel it when extreme events happen.  For instance, my grandfather died last week and I was sad about it but I no longer feel depressed for no reason.  The stages of mania I used to experience have almost completely subsided.",8,91,3
"Risperdal","Anonymous","July 9, 2010","-","This medication did not work well for me at all, and I got the unfortunate side effect of lactation. At the time I was sixteen and that's just something that I was not willing to deal with.",3,27,3

"Risperdal","bipolarbabe","November 17, 2009","-","Better than some drugs, but Lamictal has been better. I still had manic episodes on this medicine, but sometimes I would forget to take it. Yet I knew there were times when I was taking it that I still got manic. But my spouse could tell the difference when I wasn't taking it, so it must have done something for me.",5,15,3
"Risperdal","Anonymous","November 10, 2009","-","I am currently taking this new medicine and it has really helped me control my mood swings better than any other medicine that I have taken in the past.

"Risperdal","Mom 101","October 28, 2009","-","My daughter took this medication for about one year.  It helped with her mood swings but the side effects are not worth it.

"Risperdal","Anonymous","September 7, 2009","-","The positive effects of this drug were negated by the adverse side effects I experienced, which included about five episodes of urinary incontinence and slowed motor coordination (my speech and movement were noticeably delayed to the point that I was taken off Risperdal because of this).  I would recommend using this medicine to treat acute episodes as needed and not on a long-term basis.",5,43,3
"Risperdal","Billy from illinois","July 30, 2009","-","This has been a miracle drug for me and my wife, it has brought a balance between us that has never been there.

The medicine worked right away and I have never been happier. I am a better person, mother and wife now.",10,142,4

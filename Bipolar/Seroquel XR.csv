"Seroquel XR","Slim Chuggins","April 8, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Finally was able to get back on Quetiapine after adding fiber pills to my diet and I am loving sleep.  Spent my whole life not sleeping well or at all lately (was up for almost a week a straight last year).  Quetiapine IR was a sure fire way of knocking me out within an hour and staying asleep to well into the morning. Pretty groggy though and had to keep increasing my dose.  My Pdoc recently sent the XR version into pharmacy instead and it is rather different. I don’t get knocked out right away which means I can create a better sleep hygiene routine.  If I am more relaxed I don’t need to be put to sleep but gradually work my way into it. It does take a minute to fully wake up but I have to say I feel my overall mood remains pretty stable for most of the rest of the day.",10,6,1

"Seroquel XR","Sofie","September 4, 2019","Taken for 10 years or more","I have Bipolar Disorder Type 2. I'm on Seroquel XR 150mg for 10 years now. Before I was on Seroquel 300mg for more than a year. I have tried different antipsychotic medicines combination for years but only Seroquel works for me. Changed my life for the better. I have chronic insomnia, tried all sleeping pills but only lasted for weeks then I couldn't sleep anymore. But Seroquel put me to sleep, deeper sleep and wake up feeling better. I just need to sleep every night on the same time. Also I gained weight, and the side effect when I feel groggy at night I feel hungry so I ended up eating at midnight. I know it sucks that I gained weight. Tried to stop taking it for few days then my depression attack me very sudden and my mood fluctuations. From then I never stop taking Seroquel and I feel better. I told to my psychiatrist that Seroquel is my best friend, without it I feel horrible. It is indeed a lifesaver.",0,13,1

Was sectioned 2016, was changed to 700 mg Quetiapine XR. Yes a very high dosage. My weight was 49 kg gained weight very fast to 67 kg, not happy at all, I have put myself on a diet (carbs are the problem with this medication)  I have all the side effects that are on the leaflet that you get with the medication. I guess many of you know the side effects.

I have many side effects &amp; other health issues.",7,5,1
"Seroquel XR","BeforeMidnite","February 7, 2019","-","I've taken this med in the past. I required a higher dosage because I was feeling paranoid. A few months ago, I weaned myself off of it, but I took other meds. I started to lose weight, and I was feeling healthy physically, but mentally my mind was active. I don't feel paranoia like I did in the past, but lately I'm taking a low dose of 150mg compared to 600mg several months ago. If I take it too soon before bedtime, I tend to feel groggy in the morning, and it takes me 9 hours of sleep. It can cause weight gain, and diabetes. Make sure you have your blood sugar monitored every 3 months. Eat small snacks, less carbs and exercise. Healthy sleep make you happy.",8,9,1

I have found that Seroquel XR has been a life saver. The immediate release made me sleep walk and sleep eat and would wear off halfway through the night. The XR stays in my system longer and helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. Only downfall is if I don't set an alarm on the weekends I could easily sleep 12+ hours.",8,4,1

I have been on many meds and combinations for 20 years, but this (along with much soul- searching, personal responsibility and facing truth, therapy, and DBT skills) has stabilized my Bipolar I and almost cured by borderline personality disorder. I had resigned myself to a difficult and tragic life before this happened. I was inspired to move to a single med, because I was a long time user of Lithium, SSRI, Lamictal combo and wanted to try for a baby. This ended up giving me new life- my own.",10,16,1

Was barely able to turn around and drive back home.  Then, recently, ten years later I was prescribed SEROQUEL XR. Again. I didn’t make the connection to the first time.  Took the 100mg dosage two nights ago. Uncontrollable convulsions and seizures. I have restless leg syndrome and my legs were flying all around.  No way to lie down and sleep, so I walked around the house for four hours, occasionally I sitting at my desk for a bit.  No sleep. Then, the next day I suffered the entire day suffering from cognitive dissonance. I kept going in and out of  the moment.  And I would spend  about thirty seconds in this state, then return for a minute or two. This cycle went on all day long.  Third day now and back to  normal.  Not taking anything now.",1,1,1

No more mania and no more suicidal thoughts in the past year of taking this med!it completely squashed my mania and stopped my racing thoughts better than any other medication!

"Seroquel XR","Longhorn Grad","November 18, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was taking 300 mg of Seroquel XR for 6 months. The best part was being able to get a good night’s sleep. I had only been getting 2-3 hrs rest each night. My mind would race and it was a struggle to stay in bed. I would get up and start cleaning. Additionally, I would spend hours creating plans to organize my life. I had not actually followed any of those plans and I was depressed. I took Latuda for a short period but it made my inability to sleep worse. That’s when I was switched to Seroquel. I loved the way it helped me feel normal. The bad - I gained 30 lbs in 6 months. I asked to be taken off and started taking Geodon. Once again I cannot sleep. I am going to ask to go back to Seroquel XR and focus on following a healthy diet.",9,9,1

I was originally prescribed it about a year ago for insomnia related to my Bipolar 2.  It worked to get me to sleep, but eventually I started to have enormous amounts to rectal pain, so I went off of it when I stopped cycling.  I was put on it again this year when my cycling started again, and I again had the same pain.   It was absolutely awful.  So I am off of it now and never want to be put on it again.",3,5,1
"Seroquel XR","Musician8907","August 17, 2017","-","I have been taking this drug for a year and a half and it has changed my life. I've tried various drugs and lifestyle treatments over 5 years of great instability and desperation, going between breakdown after breakdown. Finding the right dose and preparation (slow release) has not only lifted me from crisis, but improved my wellbeing to an all time level. (It took a little while to adjust.) In particular it guarantees me a good night sleep and I can up the dose slightly if things slip. It has done wonders for my anxiety and given me the stability to really be what I want to be. I feel it is important to note that the drug is one part of the picture, and mindfulness, exercise, social/professional support etc. are important where possible",10,17,1

So my Dr switched to seroquel 200mg extended release and it was a GODSEND form of drug! Barely any of sedating effects and even lack of any hungover.... And the best part was that I forgot to eat breakfast by accident several times in a week.... If for immediate release I would be going crazy for missing breakfast. Imagine that!",10,7,1

I never had any of that before; my bipolar destroyed my whole life. Seroquel gave it back. I hear of people wanting to go off Seroquel.. I'm the opposite.  I would go to any lengths to make sure I never have to go off it. I'll gladly spend the rest of my life on it, because it gives me a normal life, and I won't risk that for anything.

"Seroquel XR","B303","May 13, 2017","-","SeroquelXR has changed my life for the better. I am currently on 400mg once daily. (I also take klonopin before I go to work). For the last 6 months, I have not had to call out sick from work, which was a monthly occurrence before Seroquel.  I have not had to take a leave of absence in  the last year. I used to have to take 2 six week leaves a year. I feel much more positive about my job and my life in general. It has been a game changer for me. The only down side is the weight gain. It seems to slow your metabolism down and increase your appetite after taking it, making it difficult to loose weight. I am currently not overweight, so the weight gain is a small price to pay. I do have to exercise  regularly and watch more carefully what I eat",9,17,1
"Seroquel XR","Patient 2545865","April 29, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I don't understand all the negative reviews. For me this pill has worked well. It's calmed me right down and has been blissful at moments. It's expensive unfortunately.  As for weight gain, I've noticed that it's pretty neutral... Granted I'm weaning off of Zoloft as well so who knows but I find with medications with 'weight gain' as a side effect just trying your hardest to eat a well balanced diet will prevent it. It's too easy to give up and say oh well I'm gonna get fat - - it's very much not the case.  Don't give up, if you're bipolar like me there's a chance you can do a lot with your brain so give it a shot and take your life back. I think much more clearly and am more productive.

I have suffered for DECADES with anxiety and panic attacks and SSRIs have stopped working for me. When I started taking seroquel it was like I finally saw color in the black and white world I was living in. My moods are completely under control and my anxiety is controlled for the most part. This medication definitely has side effects. Its a tranquilizer. It makes you very tired. It also made me gain a significant amount of weight...but I would rather deal with the side effects then deal with the horrible anxiety I was living with everyday.

My depression has been through the roof as well! And to top it off, the weight I have gained since I have been on it, has been insane. I constantly wanna eat all the time!

BUT since I've been seeing my doctor regularly and she seems to genuinely care I've trusted her judgment with her diagnosis and what she thought would help me most.... besides the weight gain, honestly I feel much more stable &amp; I can deal with the world around me as I see it and haven't had any serious depressive episodes or hypomania.

Doesn't work for depression either. When I was on it I hurt myself and was thinking about suicide. It didn't stop my racing thought. My OCD is the same. Man just no. I gained 40 pounds in 2 months just with 250mg. It's the worst medication of its category. I was on Zyprexa before but besides the horrible weight gain at least I was doing much better. I hate this medication. Do not take it people. It makes you fat doesn't help at all. No man just NOOO. I'm going back to Paxil 30mg and Zyprexa 7.5 mg which work so much better.

As I adjusted to the medication this wore off.  I now function better than I ever have.  Suicidal thoughts are pretty much all gone, and when they do come, they pass.

Luckily for me (perhaps, lol), my insurance considera me catastrophic due to my checkered past, and pays the entire price because they want me to take this medication and stfu lol. Since taking Seroquel XR, my life has improved so much, and I really have never felt more stable in my life. I've tried anticonvulsants and other antipsychotics and they have not worked for me.

She immediately stopped the anti-depressant because it was elevating mood into mania. She dropped lithium to one dose at night to aid kidney wear and tear. She stopped olanzapine because I was still having mild persistent psychosis and put me on 800mg of quetiapine  (seroquel).

Even on Cipralex my mood was constantly changing so I went to see a psychiatrist who thinks I may have Cyclothymia or bipolar 2 so started me on 50mg of Seroquel.  Initially I was very groggy but have gotten over that. I've also gained a stone in weight. But my mood has really stabilised for the first time. I feel happy,  confident and passionate. I no longer have a million thoughts in my head so can focus better. Hopefully this continues.",8,56,2

I feel a lot calmer, which is definitely needed for me, especially at night.  It helps with racing thoughts and voices as well.  No more noise in my head at night for most part.",10,68,3

I exercise at least three times a week and eat well, yet I have gained 20kg (44.09 pounds) in the 8 months that I have been on this medicine.  Another issue I have is vivid dreams.

I would stop taking it on and off when I felt better but then would use other meds to bandage my symptoms...get back on then off again...until one day I decided to stop with the denial and allow someone to help me for real. I've been on it now faithfully for 9 months...but I've put on 60lbs! It makes me eat after hours in the middle of the night. I'm depressed because of the weight gain.

Some medicines worked for a short time, and others just didn't work. So my psychologist put me on Lamictal, but it works very slowly and you have to start it on a low dose and work your way up. I had taken it before, but my other doctor left and every other doctor wanted to put me on Lithium but I said no because I have Lupus.

When I got out of the hospital and sought out a new psychiatrist for treatment, he took me off of the Seroquel because I am diabetic. After a year of unsuccessful treatment with other medicines, I begged to be put back on the Seroquel because the depression was unbearable, and I wasn't responding to other medicines. So he agreed and once again that switch has been flipped on and I feel normal! I am only on 300mg. I have to take it early because it knocks me out.

I can finally hold a job. Like I said I have my life back, something I was told would never happen. Seroquel XR is that reason for that.

Rather increased appetite..hence 40 pd weight gain. But I prob would've never gotten married and had kids if it weren't for this medicine mixture.

Now sometimes I do nothing but sleep for as long as 5-6 days only getting up to eat, shower and use the bathroom. My energy level has gone from 9 to 3 on a good day. Marriage is in trouble too.  I've had dosage adjustments all over the place and am back to my starting dose of 3/25. 6/50 was the worst. Now taking an additional 20mg of fluoxetine during the day but it doesn't help so I'm stopping that. I'll stick with the lowest dose and start drinking coffee or something to get me going.

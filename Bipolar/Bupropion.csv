"Bupropion","JBakes","April 8, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Prescribed Bupropion (Zyban) for my depression associated with Bipolar II Disorder. We started at 150mg some time ago and it must not have worked as when I went back we increased to 225mg. Still complaining of depression we later increased to 300mg at which point I started to experience unpleasant side effects (sleep disturbance, racing thoughts, anxiety). I can safely say this drug did not do its job and I am disappointed I was not put on other drug/s recommended by the literature before this one. It has taken me 6-12 months to work this out. Plus it is hideously expensive.",2,2,1
"Bupropion","K","April 7, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","So I have a history of Bupropion. I first started it in July 2019 for bipolar disorder and lasted only 3 days on 150XL. My doctor was sure that after months of other meds not working that this would be the one for me. It caused tremors in my hands and face and it was horrible. I then started taking Latuda 60mg. I decided for anxiety to start taking the bupropion again after my doctor recommended it. I started out on 100mg. I then upped it to 150 but it caused manic episodes. So I lowered it back to 100mg. It’s been very beneficial since then and it’s very helpful in my cocktail of meds. This plus Latuda and Zoloft have changed my life and all my anxiety is pretty much gone and the bipolar is under control.",9,3,1
"Bupropion","Riley","March 10, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","My doctor put me on bupropion XL 150mg and it was awful! Two weeks in I started having terrible anger and irritability spells to where I would just scream. After 17 days I had to stop taking it. The worst side effect I’m actually STILL having though since stopping is actually weight GAIN !?! I have even decreased my calories and increased my exercise to bring my weight back to normal but nothing is working! I’ve become so frustrated and my doctors are no help. Has anyone else experienced weight gain from this medication not related to overeating ? I am so desperate for answers :(",1,5,1
"Bupropion","Whaddup","November 23, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I LOVE THIS MEDICATION!! After trying Lexapro which ended up not working at all, (I found out I genetically don’t respond to SSRI’s), my psychiatrist prescribed 150mg of Wellbutrin XL(Bupropion HCL). This is the only thing that was able to pull me out of a deep  depression! Before this medication I had constant suicidal ideation, and would always be upset/having crying episodes. I would hate everyone and everything. Even though I still experience a little irritability from time to time, I’ll take it over the symptoms I was experiencing before. I did have to bump up my dose to 300mg though eventually because I was still experiencing breakthrough symptoms on 150mg. This medication combined with Lamictal changed my life!!! Currently, this is the best I’ve ever felt.",10,13,1
"Bupropion","A-nonny-mouse","October 13, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","If you have Bipolar Disorder type II, please learn as much as you can about this condition from professional, reputable sources so you can make informed decisions about treatment and management options. This is a treatable, manageable illness, take hope in that.   After 20+ years struggling to cure myself naturally &amp; being miserable, dangerously depressed &amp; dysfunctional, I finally decided to try psych medication.   I found a doctor who SPECIALISES in this disorder and is up to date with the latest research findings in this specific condition. If you don't like your current GP or Psych's attitude, find someone else! I started a combo of Lamictal (AM &amp; PM) &amp; Seroquel (Only PM - makes you drowsy). I kept a daily mood diary &amp; it took 3 months for my mood to fully stabilise. To help the bipolar depression, we added bupropion &amp; N-Acetyl Cysteine, a supplement (all based on clinical research!). For 5 years now, I’ve had my life back.  Deciding to take this medication saved my life.",10,5,1
"Bupropion","Darktragedy","August 28, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","After having a breakdown and realizing I'm bipolar, not major depressive like I was diagnosed with over twenty years ago, my Dr started me on this. I had been on it years ago and had done well until it started making me anxious. This time it completely stopped my impulsivity, my compulsive behavior and brought me out of the horrible pit I was in. It took a good two months to get me stable and I lost weight in the beginning. Then I started craving carbs bad, but I switched from the 12 hour to instant release and it's much better now. I have better energy with the instant and no more headaches like the SR gave me. Still not quite where I want to be, but better than I was.",9,2,1

"Bupropion","Deco","July 17, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I've been on this for almost 4 weeks. I am overweight as a result of other meds &amp; emotional eating, which I do when depressed- for some reason especially when someone else is eating-- it's almost an impulse. I have lost five pounds now and find myself able to turn down sweets, be satisfied on normal portions, and generally able to control saying No to mindless and emotional eating. I can see why this would help smokers- I was becoming addicted to food. This alone has made me feel optimistic, but it was only after a couple of days that I began to notice certain other behaviors changing toward my self but more importantly others who deserved better from me. I hope that this proves to be what I need, I'm tired from trying so many other meds that haven't worked!",8,10,1
"Bupropion","Mongo","July 4, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was always a Crazy Child and people envied my character and confidence. Although they all saw me as that, I was actually going through a lot in my head. I would be the happiest person alive in the room, while my mind was thinking of how I could end it all. I lived with that for 19 years no medication. I hate medication, but after being in a 2 month slump of depression I decided it was time. My DR told me it might or might not work but it would help with that nicotine addiction so I was for it. After taking it 3 days I felt hot, different, and had a horrible date (she doesn't talk to me now), so I stopped. I felt good the next week but felt depressed again so I tried again for a few weeks and felt good for the most part except the anxiety just ruined my confidence and sex drive. I am still feeling like I'm not right and I and in a continuous cycle of not knowing what to do. It is great for depression but for Biplar Disorder it its a hit or miss..",3,3,1

I take lamictal and since then it’s hard for me to tell when I’m depressed because I don’t experience mania on lamictal. But over time the bupropion started making me feel sedated, foggy, and highly unmotivated. I wasn’t really feeling depressed, I just wasn’t feeling much of anything and I was dissociating a lot. I decided one morning to just stop taking it and it’s been a week and I feel almost 100% better. I’ve been able to actually get off my couch and do things again!",5,5,1

Has lifted me out of a deep debilitating depression so far but won’t go higher since a higher dose triggered my manic episodes. Refuse to take lamictal or lithium etc. because side effects like weight gain, liver damage etc scare me really bad. Haven’t had any noticeable side effects but know 150mg is low dose.

When I finally fell asleep, I’d wake up repeatedly through the night, making me fatigued all day. At day four, my coworker asked if I was okay because she said I hadn’t smiled all day and I looked  dead  in my face. It didn’t occur to me that I’d gone from being very social to very antisocial. I can’t remember when the anxiety crept in. And irritability. But by day five and six, I was swearing at my 9-year-old, which is so absolutely not me. I was so angry, beyond irritated. At only day seven, I stopped. I was previously diagnosed as Bipolar II and take Tegretol. Here I am, five days beyond the quit date, and at least I have my personality back. My sleep is insane; I can sleep again, but I slept 12 hours last night. It’s like I’m catching up for a week of disruption. What seems to still be lingering is stifling anxiety.",1,4,1

I titrated up to 300 XL and honestly didn't feel much difference other than being much more irritable than usual. I then (do not recommend) went directly down to 150XL.  PLEASE do not cold turkey this drug. Everyone is different but my experience in this was awful. I have never had withdrawals that bad from a drug. I was hospitalized for having severe anxiety and depressed thoughts that are now still lingering after two weeks.

"Bupropion","Josh1447","November 27, 2017","-","This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It's helped provide me with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs and so far there hasn't been any side effects. Within 3 weeks the effects peaked. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn't be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don't be afraid to try this drug.",9,20,1

I was taking other antidepressants at that time. They were helping to make me at least functional, most days just doing the bare minimum seemed too much. Eventually my PCP added 150 mg of Wellbutrin XL on top of the medication I was already taking. Since then we have up to 300 mg. I finally have energy,  a desire to do things, and i feel the happiest i have been in a long time.

I've been taking for almost two months now and my anxiety has greatly intensified.  I also have muscle aches in my legs and back - not sure if it's related to the bupropion, but I didn't have these feelings before I started taking it.  It did not help me lose weight, but I did finally plateau after gaining consistently on Paxil and Abilify.  I'm still taking Abilify so maybe that's interfering with weight loss, I'm not sure.   Also my depression was under control for awhile but with the relentless anxiety about everything, it's creeping back in.  Everything feels like an effort and all I want to do is stay in bed all day.

Both times I took the 150 mg extended release form. When I took it the first time I didn't experience any mood-altering effects, but I did lose a significant amount of weight. In fact, my psychiatrist had to take me off the medication when I dropped below 90 lbs. The second time I took bupropion was when I had to come off lithium due to thyroid damage. This time it was life changing. All of my depressive symptoms melted away without inducing any hypomania. I still lost weight, but not as much this time around.

This is input from both me and several other patients I have spoken to in the hospital and outpatient programs with similar accounts: Wellbutrin is a miracle drug for some people, but, especially if you are bipolar, you have to be extremely careful about the dosage. I've had severe depression symptoms for 10 years. After a month of starting, I didn't have what I would consider a moderate depressive episode for the next two months, and can now enjoy life again.

I figured if I expected the worst possible scenario anything better was a win. It was as if I was at war with the world, everything was a battle. Been on Welbutrin for 6 weeks now, 300mg a day in 2 doses to start. Gave me ridiculously bad headaches (I suffer from migraines already) but my mood, interest, and general sense of well being were better. Doc changed me from 2 doses to 3 doses a day (still 300 mg). No more headaches but slight insomnia so far. 3-4 hours a night now, usually get 6-7 hours of sleep. And I have the dry mouth as well. I will deal with the insomnia and cotton mouth. To me this is worth it.",0,65,3

Went back on Zoloft - it did nothing. Tried it in combo with Wellbutrin - nothing. Tried just the wellbutrin - nothing... except a 25 pound weight gain. Everyone says you lose weight on Wellbutrin... uh.. not so much! I gained 25 lbs in spite of barely eating and taking up running...AND.. it made me sweat ALL THE TIME. It did nothing for my mood, but the side effects were completely depressing. P.S. the weight did NOT come off after I quit taking it. My guess is it damaged my already slow metabolism.",0,30,3

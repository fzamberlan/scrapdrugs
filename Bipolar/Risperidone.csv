I started risperidone a year ago. It makes me calm, I hardly get angry, I have no anxiety, and I have not had an episode since I started it. I feel great on it in general. The down side -- It makes me lazy, I'm so chill now that I'm totally comfortable just sitting on the couch. I feel relaxed and balanced but without the anxiety I have no reason to get up and run it off. The biggest and worst issue I have with it is the damn weight gain. I've always been super fit and thin but now I have a belly that I just can't get rid of. If the it didn't work so well for my mood I would get off of it immediately to lose my weight. I would still recommend it and I won't be stopping it anytime soon.",0,3,1

I remember feeling very neutral, slowed down, apathetic and emotionless. I felt like a zombie. I was stiff in the way I moved. I gained 8 pounds in less than 2 weeks and gained even more after that going from 128lb to 148lb unfortunately. I had body issues my whole life and this drug has made me hate my body so much more. The nurses gave me this medication without my consent not telling me about the problems with weight gain. When I expressing concern about it, they did not care. I have no sexual drive at all. I slept 12 hours a day and still felt tired during the day. My prolactin levels were very high. I lost so much hair. I had acne. It was the absolute worst drug of my life. I do not recommend at all. Please avoid at all costs. It ruined my life.",2,6,1
"Risperidone","Leanna","February 9, 2020","-","Weight gain is a problem off the cuff. Take your dose at night otherwise you will sleep all day. Stops mania but keeps you quite numb to all emotions.

No real side effects for me apart from the weight gain and fatigue.",5,5,1

I was hospitalized two times with psychosis and this is what they gave me. It took a few weeks to really kick in. At first I was tired. I have been on the med for almost five years now. I am able to live a normal life although I still have some depression. I take 4mg risperdal which I just increased from 3mg because at times I would have mild hallucinations or delusions when tired or the like. They are almost non existent now, really just coming on if I have caffeine. I did gain weight but not meaningfully so. The trick is to watch your calories and exercise as much as possible. I would recommend trying this for severe psychosis. I also take 600mg lithium which seems to help my mood. I like to think that the lithium helps the brain from the damage risperdal can cause.

"Risperidone","vandalized corpse","September 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Risperdal Consta (risperidone):</b>			 Again a terrible tragedy that I was subjected to this drug against my will because of a temporary behavioral anomaly. After a month of taking became very hallow and unbelievably slow, especially at tasks such as reading, thinking, and communicating. Periodically had some sort of dyskinesia and felt like all the memory was being sucked out of me and I would have to get stuck in a weird transition state . It was a very frightening and terrible experience, as if I could not take care of myself. The only way to get rid of that catatonia was to take sedatives and sleep it off. I am not sure how to label this symptom, but I will guess the most appropriate labelling would be either catatonia or severe delirium with dyskinesia. The symptom disappeared after 6 months of not taking this medicine.",0,9,1
"Risperidone","Anonymous","August 21, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I think there are two sides to risperidone. Mentally it is a fantastic medication, it slows down racing thoughts and really calms down manic symptoms and you sleep so well. I was oversedated when I first started taking it but after a few months got acclimated to it. Physically it's a disaster. Weight gain is hard to control (40 LBS in 2 years) although I have a desk job and don't get a lot of exercise. I would say if you start taking this to diet right out the gate, you will want to eat more. And watch out for uncontrollable muscle movements/spasms.",8,12,1

I started off taking 0.5 mg once a day then upped it to 1mg. Was on 1mg for a while. It worked well for me. I stopped seeing hallucinations and for the most part my mania and depression and lessened or gone away. I woke up every day feeling refreshed. Even my period cramps were usually less painful than before. Everything would go downhill when I decided to stop the medication, all the symptoms would come back quickly and badly.

Significant weight gain, lethargy, increased anxiety at times, waking up a lot during sleep.  The good is that it does slow down my mania pretty well, I’d say I’m 80% manic and 20% depressive.  Mania had been causing me problems for years.  I had been taking 1mg twice a day and it was too much, and I’m a 6’4  240 lb man.  Risperidone 1mg daily does the trick with less side effects, but definitely talk with your doctor before getting on this med, there are probably better options out there for treatment of bipolar disorder.",3,2,2

I take the generic version for Bipolar 2 and have been trying over 30 meds for 5 years. I used to take Seroquel and Divlaprox but they stopped working for me and I was too tired. My mood is the most stable I've ever been and I am level headed and clear. I take .5 mg every night and find this is a good dose because I used to take more and was very out of it. This helps me sleep but not be drowsy. Honestly, it's not perfect as I'm dealing with depression currently. I tried prozac but it made me suicidal/dissociate and zombie like and less like myself. Because of this I just recently stopped prozac but I plan to try other antidepressants with this to help my depression. Overall, I love that I mostly feel like myself again. I just want to care about life more now and be less apathetic. DBT therapy helps. Also, acne on my body/face from this but no weight gain so I can't complain too much.",0,12,2

"Armodafinil","CC","March 21, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve been on Nuvigil 150mg for several weeks and it has brought me out of the fog I was feeling. It's side effect  has been that it has  increased the number and severity of my premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). I will have to monitor that but I am hopeful that I can get back to having a somewhat normal life. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about 10 years ago and have been fighting to live. I’m on a lot of other meds that zap my energy and I already don’t have any so I’ve been isolated for a while.  Just hoping this med will make my cocktail of meds finally work well.",7,0,1
"Armodafinil","dianemob","March 11, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I've had treatment resistant depression for 25 years. Nothing worked. A theory was bipolar without mania - only depression. In the bipolar spectrum I would rate 5 - family history with no mania, only depression. Long story short - Nuvigil saved my life. I could feel peace of mind, contentment, pleasure, increased social interaction and libido. I've been taking Nuvigil for almost 3 years and have had to increase numerous times to the point where I take bigger doses. I've never had any side effects.  Now my doctor won't increase my dose. Over the past year I've watched myself gradually go downhill to the point where I've become socially isolated, can't feel pleasure, etc. The docs worry about side effects at a higher dose. Why can't anyone understand that no side effect is worse than having major depression?",10,13,1
"Armodafinil","Bipolar Bob","April 3, 2016","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been on this drug since the US release date, previous to that having to cross the border into Mexico to buy Provigil. Luckily I have no insurance hiccups with Nuvigil besides yearly prior authorizations. I have sleep apnea to which I've had 5 surgeries to correct &amp; am Bipolar 1. I take 2 x 250 mg. tablets daily, spaced by 5 hours--it really helps with the extreme lethargy you get from atypicals &amp; mood stabalizers, I don't think I'd be able to hold a job without it. This is not some miracle Limitless drug for those who seriously need it, its a way to change your life to keep up when all your other meds just slow you down. I was on 1 dose a day &amp; it wore off within 5-6 hours, thus the second dose. $5 copay with coupon on their site.",9,10,1
"Armodafinil","astokely","January 3, 2016","-","I started using nuvigil two months ago to help ease the symptoms of depression associated with my bioplar II. Overall this medication has by no means cured me, but it has allowed me to become much more functional when I am depressed. It helps me think a lot clearer, makes me more positive, and most importantly just gives me the motivation to get stuff done when I would otherwise have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. I only take this when I am depressed, as I have found it makes me kind of irritable when I am hypomanic and it just makes it really hard to sleep. The only downside is that I have to live on samples because insurance doesn't cover a penny of it:(",8,12,1
"Armodafinil","Bruce22","March 15, 2015","Taken for less than 1 month","I have Bipolar 1. Nuvigil to start the day and Seroquel to end it is the best combo I've ever experienced. (I also take Lamictal and Luvox)",10,10,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymuos","February 16, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I just recently started being treated for bipolar. And also just started taking Nuvigil, it has help me so much. I don't just want to sleep it has made me feel better(normal). I am kind of grateful that my doctor started treating me!",0,26,1
"Armodafinil","iloveme123","February 15, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I have been on Nuvigil for about a year.  It is a miracle.  My insured won't pay for the dosage I need so I get off of it on the weekends sometimes. I can feel a huge difference off of it and hope that the final stages of the trials produce positive results so I can get the dosage I need. I would not be alive without this medication, I am more productive, social and have no suicidal thoughts while on it.",0,33,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","January 21, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 It's been a rough 29 years discovering, living with and losing things because of bipolar, ADHD,and OCD!  Tried literally every medicine under the sun, (ours and prob a couple other solar systems too.). So many my doc looked me in my eye and told me that I might just have to learn how to live with my head, mind, thoughts, and lack of actions, or intestinal fortitude as your father calls it, he's Air Force retired after 22 yrs. Suicidal thoughts all the time.  Given all my possessions away.  Stood on the bridge, the roof, and had the gun in my hand, but I always held on, cause I knew their was something like NUVIGIL out there somewhere, I just had to hang on long enough.  If not for NUVIGIL I wouldn't have been able to focus long enough to write this!",0,55,1
"Armodafinil","bipotom747890","January 17, 2013","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I'm a Bipolar II with Panic Disorder. There is a possibility that I'm Mildly Narcoleptic also. The following Cocktail has me functioning at 100% for many years. 10mg of Abilify once  a week - Increased concentration and did away with panic disorder 1mg of Xanax Every night along with a botanical extract call Lemon Balm- For Sleep 250mg of Nuvigil- Makes me alert and awake and full of energy. I believe that the Nuvigil works for me as an Antidepressant. If you are full of energy how can you be depressed? I believe the Abilify keeps the anxiety and panic disorder and mania in check.",0,35,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","March 28, 2012","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I have bipolar disorder and I've tried many medications before we found what worked without nasty side effects. I was put on risperdone and Celexa to treat it, which I still  take. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and narcolepsy which my doctor put me on Nuvigil. I did not know Nuvigil could be a treatment for treating bipolar until I read about it on this site. I feel very upbeat with the Nuvugil and not tired all the time and I feel happy again. Even though I take other medicines for bipolar, I feel since I started the Nuvigil I feel even better.",0,29,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","December 23, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Nuvigil is a great medication. I have Bipolar disorder mixed state. I was often drowsy before taking Nuvigil. The first few days of taking 250mg of Nuvigil I felt better than ever. I was working out at the gym for an hour. Before taking the medication I couldn't even run. Depression sucked the life out of me. One of the bad side effects of Nuvigil is it induces mania/hypomania. I became hypomanic until my mood would drop down to depression and I had to take a mood stabilizer in order to normalize my mood.",0,29,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","July 17, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 I took Nuvigil for the first time and I found myself less tired and more active than ever. I have severe depression and stay tired a lot. For years, I haven't been myself as for being active I was an athlete for half my life and I knew what being in shape felt like, but with aging I fell into depression and bipolar. Still too early to say, but Nuvigil made a positive difference for at least one day of my life.",0,23,1
"Armodafinil","Anonymous","February 4, 2011","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 Third day on this medicine, it's crazy how things are going. I used to wake up and an hour later be exhausted. Barely make it through 2 hours of college and go home and sleep 5 hours until work and sleep right after work. The past couple of days I've been able to stay awake through a movie, stay up for my favorite T.V show, do homework and laundry after school, be more attentive at my job and I don't feel like I'm on speed.",0,39,1
"Armodafinil","wisdomofhearts","August 14, 2010","-","<b>Nuvigil (armodafinil):</b>			 My Bipolar II Disorder is horribly debilitating when my medications are not working or are in the middle of being adjusted.  However, when the depression and sleep problems (racing thoughts as soon as I lie down, interrupted sleep, not sleeping at all, etc.) are added to the mix, my life becomes completely unbearable.  As soon as my doctor gave me Nuvigil it was like I became myself again!  The difference was phenomenal.  I felt normal.  It is a total miracle that I can get up and do the dishes, fold laundry, shop...all the simple things that so many people take for granted.  Nuvigil gives me the energy that Bipolar Disorder steals from me.",0,114,1

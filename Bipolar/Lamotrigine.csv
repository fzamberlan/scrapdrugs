I take it in conjunction with a low dose of abilify, and the combination has kept me from having manic/depressive for about a year straight now, something I never thought possible. At first I was just on abilify— a pretty high dose— and while it kept me free from hypomania, it didn’t really do much for the depression. Lamictal, on the other hand, has worked wonders in that respect. Very little side effects— I wake up nauseous but it fades after about an hour, and it’s definitely worth it. Other than that, no weight gain, and I believe it may have actually increased my previously nonexistent sex drive. The best part of lamictal is that I don’t feel flat or subdued. I’m still having the normal ups and downs of life, but for the first time, I feel pretty confident that they’re not bipolar related. It’s really been a miracle drug for me.",0,52,1

This med will likely exacerbate these and increase your chance of developing SJS. My psychiatrist at the time had not informed me of this.

Over time, I developed mixed and irritable hypomanic states to which Lamotrigine had little to no effect. PDoc increased the dose to 75-ish and I got migraines, forgetfulness, and itchy bumps across my back, chest, and shoulders along with cystic acne. I'm in the process of switching to Trileptal. Topamax might be another option for folks experiencing headaches and looking for something more stupefying in the same family. Lamo is largely prescribed for unipolar depression.

The risk for harmful rash STS is present but rare (I think it’s 3 in 1000 people). This risk is reduced by ramping up slowly. It took time to achieve a therapeutic dose. Lamictal is less effective when combined with hormonal birth control, so I take a higher dose.  I’ve experienced depressive and hypomanic episodes on lamictal, but they were efficiently managed by increasing the dose or adding an antidepressant.

But with the Zoloft and Prozac I would go into extreme manic states and clean my floors for 6 hours, spend all my money on crap, cry uncontrollably or even get violent. I was like that already just worse on those medicines. Finally seeing another doctor trying to find help he put my on Lamictal. Small dose at first and now I'm on 400mg/day. I have gained weight 15 pounds and have been on a diet for a year and see a personal trainer. Absolutely cannot lose weight. I still have all of my same bipolar symptoms but they are not uncontrollable now. I am on lithium 200mg/day",0,33,25

Many people don't know about using it as an alternative to SSRIs for mood stabilization, depression and bipolar disorder. I've been on it for 1 year.

The sexual side effects and weight gain I experienced on Prozac, and the restlessness and irritability of Celexa and Welbutrin, just don't occur for me on this medicine.

I do not experienece the excessive anger, compulsive highs and excessive OCD. I was never a really depressive person but was not able to think clearly thus making poor decisions.

That was the darkest moment of my life. Now, I am happier and balanced. I never knew life could be this good.

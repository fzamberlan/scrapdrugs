"Vraylar","BB","June 7, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve only been on it for 3 days, I get so tired the first few hours until I try to actually go to sleep then I’m restless, can’t stop moving. Overheating with chills, and I feel sick the whole time I’m on it. Nausea and headaches are very bad, consistently thirsty, and body aches! I don’t know if this is normal starting out, I know that some medications make you feel sick at first but this is unbearable.",1,2,1

"Vraylar","Vicky","March 7, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed this Vraylar for bipolar 2, mainly depression. I have been on it for a few weeks and I think this is the one that will change my life. I have a good level of mental energy for the first time ever (but not wired, like a stimulant), I suddenly have no problem motivating myself to do the things I want to do, I don’t have the urge to overeat, and I am a happier, more cheerful person. I have had none of the extra pyramidal or cognitive side effects, but it did make me a little bit hypomanic at first and has made my sleep very fragmented, so I have had to take Saphris some nights to bring me down and help me sleep. All of the bad reviews and potential side effects made me scared to try it for a while, after having had a bad experience with another atypical antipsychotic, but the benefits have far outweighed any mild side effects I’ve experienced.",9,37,1
"Vraylar","Kp111","March 1, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","This is the worst medicine I have ever taken. It actually made my manic and compulsive buying worse. It messed with my sleep schedule and my blood sugar. I’m normally 103-105 lbs. I was constantly hungry on this and my blood sugar would plummet between meals. I gained 7 lbs in 2 months after my doc put me on 3mg. I have switched to lithium and feel like a new person.",1,12,1
"Vraylar","Hen247","February 29, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’ve been on Vraylar for about 4 weeks. First few days I was really tired, day 4 I felt better, improved mood. Then I started to get cognitive impairment. Couldn’t keep up with conversations, could hardly string a sentence together. My doctor wanted to increase to 3mg, so I did. Depression got a lot better, but had anxiety attacks, and fidgeting, restlessness, didn’t find any pleasure in watching TV, couldn’t concentrate. Could barely work cos I couldn’t concentrate or talk to people. I have weaned off 3mg to 1.5mg, but it wasn’t easy. Now I don’t know if I’ve got the courage to completely stop, I know depression will kick in. Any thoughts?",3,16,1
"Vraylar","Anonymous","February 27, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I took two weeks of samples and started on week three when the side effects seriously started. First major hot flashes. Then the over eating and always thirsty. Then I started noticing I was constantly moving. I could not sit or stand still. My feet, my hands and hyperactivity. I also was constantly talking and over talking people. I couldn't wait. Everything had to be now. I stopped taking it and after two days was feeling much better. I have taken other medications and this was one of the worst.",1,13,1

Vraylar has been WONDERFUL.  The first week was the worst week ever.  The sweating, I couldn't sit still at all, and I thought I was losing it... I made it to week two and all of that went away.  It was tough.  I still can't sit still well and get bored of things way faster then usual. I don't even care for my TV shows anymore... too hard to sit through.  However, the benefits FAR outweigh the cons.  Give it more then one week for sure...",8,26,1

I’m totally stabilized but the issue I have is ever since I started taking it I haven’t had a period. And I’m not sure if this is a side effect of the vraylar.

"Vraylar","Some lady","February 10, 2020","-","Vraylar was the first drug I have ever used to treat my bipolar. I was scared out of my mind, but I finally took it. There were side effects the first few weeks that tapered off. I am in ongoing therapy which I think is really important.  Bottom line I am really glad I got over my fears and took it. I'm no longer depressed but I am feeling things now after a long time. Laughing more, yelling more, getting mad, and being more productive. I was depressed for a long time. I feel like I'm at the beginning of getting my life back. I was very concerned about weight gain so I work out every day .. at least thirty minutes of walking or going to the gym. I got really hungry so I joined weight watchers to track my food intake and get advice. I eat a ton of fruit and drink water all day. It's forcing me to be healthy. I have lost weight and not gained. Take your time with it. The insomnia was pretty bad but I'm leveling out. Muscle stiffness was a slight problem but I do yoga or stretch everyday.",9,20,1
"Vraylar","Help me!","February 10, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","Awful, terrible med! Seriously! Makes you extremely tired! I was so excited about this med after watching the commercials and how it  covers all phases  of bipolar. At 1.5 mg, it knocks you out. On the next day, you're still just tired and have no motivation to get to work and be productive! Made my anxiety worse! Exacerbated the stress I was dealing with at the time! Would go to sleep with a knot in my gut. I quit the med and I had the worst 3 days of depression I’ve had in a while, maybe even the worst ever! I cried in front of my supervisor at work. Be careful with the withdrawals! Depression is  the worst!!!",1,17,1

I've been on it 3 months and I've had no depressive/mixed/manic episodes since then so Vraylar has been a godsend for me.",10,27,1

Finally Vraylar came on the market and my doc prescribed it. I've been on it for 2 years and have had 1 manic episode and have an anxiety disorder I never had. With that being said, Vraylar has been the best prescribed medication yet.  I have no side effects. They only problem is the cost, because it's not generic yet. So with a Medicare advantage insurance, I have a $382 out of pocket copays. Right know my physiatrist is able to give me samples. I haven't found a patient assist program that helps.",10,23,1
"Vraylar","Cat","January 2, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medication is the best one I have been on and I have been on many. Latuda made me hallucinate and I ended up jumping out a second story window. Seraquel made me sleep all of the times. Abilify did not work at all. The other medications were out of my price range.  My insurance company recommended that I try these and a few others prior to approving coverage of Vraylar. I was receiving samples from the public service agency I was in prior to my mother purchasing insurance for me. I am diagnosed Bipoar 1 with psychotic tendencies (hearing voices not in my head but in the rooms I’m in.

"Vraylar","sirenitadisterica","December 22, 2019","-","I was enthusiastic to begin Vraylar because the commercials made it look like a wonder drug for bipolar mixed episodes. I have to say it has helped but I can't know how much because I'm already on Wellbutrin (antidepressant), Lithium (mood stabilizer), and Seroquel (antipsychotic/sleep aid). Vraylar does cause wicked akathisia and, most notably for me, it does cause weight gain. I've been on it for over three months and I gained ten pounds easily. This amount is a lot for me, especially when it's so hard to lose. I am always hungry and I worry I am showing early signs of diabetes. I would like to go jogging but lately I've had no motivation to go. My swollen body feels helpless. I am going to try going off of Vraylar to see if I can become normal self.

It made me feel loopy and drowsy so taking it at night wasn’t a problem, however as soon as I would take it immediately I would fall asleep. I would then wake up at the slightest sound and not be able to go back to bed. I also had the side effect of akathisia that would keep me up. It was to the point I had to pace around to keep myself at bay. Sitting down was uncomfortable, standing up was uncomfortable as well. I also did not see much of difference in my mood.

I appreciate this after having to endure three months of lithium while working as an automotive technician. I am still with a clear head, and I haven't noticed any significant anxiety problems such as my last medication. Although, it will take weeks such as lithium to see what will actually take place, my digestive problems have diminished (huge cry out!!). I do have problems with appetite but not to a point where it has affected me while actually sitting down with food. I tend to enjoy that part no matter, and I've take medication that completely shuts off your enjoyment of food.

I get out of bed and have a purpose. I love my life. I do have blurred vision with Vraylar but I also feel its because I need a eye exam. I sleep great in vraylar and I actually have lost weight.

I feel angry, and can not handle any stress. My body feels like I need to just move and can not be comfortable with any position. My eyes are heavy and I feel like I could just fall asleep if I didn’t fight it.  I just feel so out of touch with who I am behavioral wise since taking this in a negative way.

My mom (who has a background in nursing) had to revive me. Both my blood sugar and blood pressure had crashed. I picked up the medication info. for Vraylar looked it over and saw that the med. may lower your blood sugar and blood pressure.  So the moral of the story for me was always read the med. info packet.  Also if you have naturally low blood pressure or blood sugar issues you'd be better off not taking this med.

By day 5, I couldn’t sleep more than 2-3 hours IF I was lucky. I’d wake up with chest and stomach pain filled anxiety. No appetite whatsoever. Felt like my skin was crawling. I tend to be fearful of starting new meds so I asked my doc if it was normal and he just I was experiencing my  condition  and not the meds. So, like an idiot I gave it another week. The problems only worsened. I cried everyday because my body and emotions felt so uncomfortable. The anxiety was to the point I couldn’t leave the house. All I did was want to scream and self harm (never had that desire before). I’m now three days off and the anxiety and insomnia are still very VERY real. I just want to feel better.

Maybe because I am so worried and anxious about my dizziness, but the agitation is pretty bad.  *took for two days, stopped for four days (was getting bad leg cramps and NP advised me to stop this and see if that was the cause).

Doctor encouraged me to try again (1.5mg this time) I took it for 3 days... same scenario. I read the side effects and both are listed there but this wasn't just slight discomfort, it was SEVERE. I asked my Doc if I might be allergic he said it was just the side effects and I should push through, but it was not going to happen. After reading ALL OVER THE internet anything Vraylar related, and speaking with a few people who have taken it, I have found only 25-30% have seen benefits from this medication.

Only side effects I had were slight fatigue and of course the first few days of mania. I do recommend this drug if you’re feeling empty and alone and just want to be left alone all together.

I have never been well since menopause age 50, and have tried every drug on the market. Finally, I went to a new doctor (NP) who put me on Vraylar. I was very wary of anti-psychotics because I started getting really shaky with Seroquel and Zyprexa. However, Vraylar seems OK. I have been on it for 3 months, started on 1.5 for 7 days, had to go up to 3mg due to a big manic episode that last 8 days. Vraylar stopped it the next day. The problems have been exceptionally vivid dreams and insomnia. I take many other things for insomnia, but nothing works. I have been lying awake for hours ever since starting this medication. It is such a shame as I have never felt better in my life. I am going to see my doctor on Wednesday to see what she thinks.",6,37,3

I had zero side effects, which for me is highly unusual since I often have even rare side effects from most drugs. As for weight gain, I haven’t noticed any from it.

I’m also not eating throughout the day, which could be causing me to binge at night and eat when I wake in the night.  I’m going to continue with Vraylar.

No matter what time of day I take it I have trouble sleeping. My emotions are dulled, but at least I'm not having manic or depressive episodes, so I guess it's worth it. I have a lot of trouble with concentration and memory, but my doctor says that's not med related (I think it is though because I wasn't having those issues before.)

Her manic episodes had been limited to rage, and after starting Vraylar, they seemed to become euphoric just prior to turning radically disphoric. The get up and go turned to akathesia. It tapered off to simply loose it's efficacy. going up to 3 mg just brought the same roller coaster. My wife is treatment resistant to many meds. If you choose to try this medication, please look out for these side effects, and keep your optimism in check.",3,22,9
"Vraylar","Jenny C.","November 5, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I have Bipolar 2 plus Panic Disorder. I started Vraylar about 10 days ago and have had a wonderful experience. It has made my days feel more stable and helped keep me calm at night when my panic attacks come. Looking forward to healing more and more.  FYI my cocktail is: Lamictal Amitriptyline Ativan Guanfacine (motor tics) Liothyronine (hypothyroid) I'm not sure yet if insurance will cover the expense of the drug, but for now I'm maxed out on my out of pocket for the year, so it's free. I guess I'll find out in January how much it will really cost. Reading reviews of this drug really freaked me out at first, but now I'm so glad I tried it. Give it a try for a few days!",9,21,9
"Vraylar","mikrw33","October 18, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I remember eagerly waiting for this medicine to come out, and when it finally did, I think I must've been one of if not the only patient my psychiatrist had on it. At first, while taking it in the morning, I felt super nauseated (lost weight from it actually), and felt like I didn't want to get out of bed for anything. So I started taking it at night, which helped a little, but then it suddenly became stimulating for me, so I started taking it in the morning again. That's when I started noticing the therapeutic benefit setting in, which took roughly a week to start setting in. I quit taking it a month and a half later because of akathisia, but decided to give it another go here recently, and haven't really had any problems.",9,24,9
"Vraylar","ReillyGirl","October 6, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I have only taken Vraylar for 5 days. The first three times I took it at night and was able to fall asleep but could not stay asleep. Each night it was worse - like wake up at 1:30 am and never go back to sleep. So I skipped a day (don't ask me why?) and then took it in the morning. Hugh difference! I have slept so much better since switching it to the morning.That is the only side effect I have had so far. I haven't really noticed any difference in my moods yet but it is really early.  The only other medication I take is lamictal (past 8 years) which has been a miracle drug for me but doesn't conquer the nagging depression that never seems to go away. I have high hopes for Vraylar! Use the drug coupon that you can download from their web!",8,27,9
"Vraylar","izzy26","September 30, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I usually don't read reviews on medication because I want to give the drug an unbiased try.  After 5 weeks on Vraylart the lowest dose, here are my adverse reactions:  insomnia, panic, paranoia, fear, mania, easily startled, itching, rash, decreased vision, dry cough, gerd, upset stomach, increased urination, loose stool.  The insomnia started immediately.  I would sleep a couple of hours and then be wide awake.  The drug wore me out because of all the resulting side effects. I had no side effects on Seroquel and, after discontinuing the Vraylar, I am relieved to be back on it.",1,16,9

The last three days I haven't been able to sleep I can't focus my thoughts I don't feel good any more.  I'm hoping to go off vraylar today or tomorrow after I talk to my doctor.",4,15,9
"Vraylar","Zoe May","September 5, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I was only on 1.5 mg Vraylar for 3 days. I had severe side effects which lasted 5 days after my doc pulled me off of this poison. The psychic and physical pain was absolute torture. The suicidal ideation I'd been experiencing prior to Vraylar ramped up big time. Every cell in my body was in screaming. My doc took me off it after 3 days. What he neglected to mention is that Vraylar stays in your system for 2 weeks. The This is my 9th day off of Vraylar and I'm finally beginning to feel better. Have had night sweats the last 3 days so my body is detoxing the Vraylar. I've been in treatment for refractory bipolar 1 mixed episodes MDD for 27 years, and Vraylar was far and away the worst experience I've had on a med, and I've been on them all.",1,27,10

"Vraylar","Moosmannman","August 17, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I began at 1.5 then titrated to 3mg dosage. At first, I loved the medicine, as it completely eliminated my depressive symptoms and helped regulate my sleep. However, after being on the medicine for two weeks, I developed Akisthesia and was told to stop. However, for those who do not experience TDS or EPS from the medicine, I imagine this will be a solid option to consider. Just be warned- the most common side effect listed is restlessness, which hit me hard and fast.",3,20,10
"Vraylar","starlight77","August 16, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","So I have been on almost every anti-psychotic out there. So now my pdoc put me on Vraylar. I was going through a bad mixed episode, severe depression, not leaving the house, racing thoughts, etc. The Vraylar has helped with all of that. My pdoc started me at 1.5mg for 2 days then upped it to 3mg. The depression got better almost immediately but now I'm having extreme anxiety- can't stop moving my leg. So he increased it yesterday to 4.5mg &amp; so far no change in the anxiety but its only been 1 day. I'm just hoping the anxiety is due to the episode &amp; not a side effect of this med. Altho now I'm feeling a tad manic. Also, sleep has been an issue. It makes me sleepy but I sleep restlestless &amp; wake up at 7am, but I'm wide and rested so its ok.",8,19,10
"Vraylar","Sudo","August 16, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Hi, this is an updated experience.  I have now been on Vraylar for just under 2 months.  Once the side effects (PAIN!!! Lack of sleep, blurred vision) wore off, it really became a miracle. Even other people notice a difference.  I did have to increase my dose, which caused severe tiredness and restlessness for a few days, but all in all it wasn't horrible. If you've been on stuff like Geodon, the tiredness isn't even comparable, but definitely tired.  My biggest issue is the weight gain. I have BED on top of Bipolar and this has made my BED rear it's ugly head BAD. But, my doctor wants me to keep with the meds because he feels it's a side effect that will wear off.  Overall, very happy with my improvement.",8,16,10

I have an addiction problem. this medicine works with your dopamine level which generally makes you happier if you truly are not happy and helps you to NOT USE. I haven't felt this good since I was a kid. I had no side affects after the first 3 days.",10,22,10

I was still having auditory hallucinations when I did too much stuff and didn't sleep properly, but that was just me. The Vraylar stopped my delusions of  everyone is trying to modify me or everyone is plotting to put me in the mental hospital. I am getting along fine with everyone now! Unfortunately, even with the copay, I can't afford it. So I'm switching to another antipsychotic. Just sharing that this medication does work.  My blood sugar didn't go sky high, which was a huge fear of mine because I did go full blown diabetic and had to be hospitalized on other antipsychotics ( which I will not name).

Went from crying everyday to doing schoolwork, activities with friends.  Only negative is the outrageous cost.  Working on that as it is not at all affordable.",8,57,10

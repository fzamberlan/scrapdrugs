I was with some friends and I was going to give them a ride home from my house and accidentally took my medication too early and I literally passed out and they had to get a ride from a friend. I was only at a 50 mg dose. This medication was just not for me. I take Latuda now, which made me really drowsy when I first started taking it but I have since gotten over it.",0,3,1
"Quetiapine","Rezzy","June 1, 2020","-","I started taking quetiapine two weeks ago thinking they were just sleeping pills from my psychiatrist cause I had some days where I just couldn't sleep and didn't realize I was manic. She made it sound like they were just for sleep cause she knows how much I don't want to be on antipsychotics. Anyways I went through a tough breakup which didn't help the body or mind when I started taking these. I find I have great sleeps, great dreams, and my mood has significantly improved. Mind you I was put on other antipsychotics last year that zombified me to the point that friends were extremely concerned I'd never be myself again. I'd say the worst side effects for me on quetiapine has been runny poos, nauseous every morning to the point I can not eat solids, I've lost a bit of weight but am actively trying to maintain it, and I'll get extremely emotional suddenly without having a reason. I'm going to continue taking them and talk to my psychiatrist soon. ALSO MY DRY MOUTH IS AWFUL AT TIMES",8,0,1

With that said, the meds are not miracles and after some dialectical treatment to add to my  tool box ... seroquel really helps. When I am restless, racing thoughts and moody I feel well balance after about 48-72 hours after using  coping skills  plus adding seroquel to prevent lack of sleep which induces worsening of thoughts, moods, eating, etc. For me, it’s very helpful to have self-relaxation skills to level my reactions. I give this medication, after months of skill work, A++. My experience is not to say it is 100% fluent to all bipolar sufferers. Good thing DBT is not a medication so won’t hurt to try it as a  tool .  The side-effects are mild. It does make me drowsy and sometimes do get oily face... yet, I can accept that over extended episodes. I also have to keep drinking lots of water as dry mouth is mild and do feel thirsty.",0,8,1

Quetiapine IR was a sure fire way of knocking me out within an hour and staying asleep to well into the morning. Pretty groggy though and had to keep increasing my dose.  My Pdoc recently sent the XR version into pharmacy instead and it is rather different. I don’t get knocked out right away which means I can create a better sleep hygiene routine.  If I am more relaxed I don’t need to be put to sleep but gradually work my way into it.

I was still irritable (because I was exhausted) and therefore becoming depressed again, the doctor gave me a script and initially said to half a 25mg tablet, just to get me over the edge.

After taking it, I would still be awake for a couple hours trying to sleep and still having racing thoughts. In the morning, I had the worst experiences trying to wake up. I wasn’t trying to wake up early or anything, like 11 on my free days so I could sleep in, and even then I could barely open my eyes enough to turn off my alarm and would immediately fall back asleep.

I have mild Bipolar I and also take Lamictal and Provigil. Without this generic Seroquel, I do NOT sleep due to racing thoughts. The only side effect is timing. I must take it 45 minutes before I want to go to sleep as that seems to be exactly when it kicks in! It can cause dry mouth and difficulty swallowing. In addition, make sure you take it and then get 6-8 hours of sleep. Otherwise you will be groggy in the morning. I think it is a life saver. I remember before Seroquel became this generic it costing $600/mo. Thankfully at that time I had medical insurance.

I got used to the side effects of daytime zombification pretty quick and it actually seemed to decrease my appetite. But the sleep is what really did it for me.  I could feel it come on like a wave of warmth and chill simultaneously and I knew I was actually going get to sleep.  I was having to titrate up relatively quickly approaching the more antipsychotic dosage and away from the sleepy doses.  But then constipation hit pretty bad after about a week of having a hard time going to bathroom that led me to eating less and less, until I was so weak I had to eat a big meal to get through the day. This led later to me nearly passing out at work with nausea and growing dizziness that lasted to severe levels for a couple of days and didn’t dissipate completely until over a month of having to quit it.

Waking up for me is literally like being a corpse and trying to dig myself out of my grave. It takes 3-4 hours to feel awake/alive again.  It also gives me extreme hunger and has made me gain a lot of weight over the past decade, at least 50 lbs. It really stimulates my appetite and also I don’t seem to feel full after eating. The exhaustion I feel throughout most of the day makes it hard to exercise regularly. That being said, it’s the only drug that can successfully knock me out for 6-8 hours. But it’s literally like having my lights punched out. It is the sleep of the dead. The worst for me is when I take my regular dose when I am anxious or physically sick...the drowsiness comes on full force but my body refuses to pass out and I spend the night feeling like I am both in a coma and having a mild manic episode...nightmares, sleeplessness, fever.",5,4,1

Went up to 50 mg and became nauseous, saw stars, heart palpitations, and my body felt extremely heavy. Stopped taking immediately after. Please note that the mood stabilizing effect only kicks in at a minimum dosage of 100 mg.

I never slept so much in my life. Instead of waking up from 12 hours of sleep feeling well rested, I woke up angry and wanting to punch someone in the face. Sure I can have anger outbursts but only while on Seroquel did I want to punch someone. Started low at 25mg and my doctor kept increasing my dosage to 100.mg At 100mg, I would sleep 18 hours straight and my days and nights were blurred. The anger caused me great urges to drink alcohol, which is ironic because I don't even like alcohol. Eventually just stopped cold turkey and to this day I have never woken up as miserable as I was on Seroquel. Also I gained 60 pounds in a little over 2 months and had severe impotence.

As someone with Bipolar Disorder who experiences severe depressive phases, two doses of Lithium Carbonate, Gabapentin as needed for anxiety, and Seroquel 150mg at night for sleep  is what is best for me.  I guess how it forces me to fall asleep and stay asleep is what in turn effects my mood to be more relaxed the next day. Who wouldn't be relaxed when they sleep 8-12 hours a night lol.

I’ve had two epically bad manic episodes in my life where I went absolutely crazy and destroyed everything, both episodes took me around 3 years to recover from. I feel like seroquel suppresses the mania and I’d recommend it to anyone looking to control their manic episodes. One of the major benefits of Seroquel is it guarantees a great nights sleep every night which is a key to preventing mania. I started on 100mg but I actually now take around 600-750mg every night which I know is a large dose but I think I’ve just gotten used to it because it’s been so long.

Currently taking 200mg. It does work, BUT it works very slowly, therapeutically talking. The anti anxiety effects kick in I would in a week or two maximum and the sleepiness is very intense in the beginning. What I don’t like about it, is that you get used to the dose very quickly and the symptoms return needing to either up or lower the dose. It’s not a super stable medicine. The first days of upping the dose you do feel more stable, calmer, peaceful but a week after you find yourself asking for more. Now therapeutically, it brings you back to earth, you know, but it’s not enough. In my case the lack of motivation is a big thing for me. It was so bad my doctor thought I had attention issues and wanted me to try Adderall and I said no because I knew it was from seroquel.

There is some weight gain I am experiencing however I am controling, and even losing the weight, with a strict diet and daily, strenuous exercise with weights. If you do not exercise and eat right on this medication there is a strong chance there will be very noticeable weight gain.

I was on Geodon but it had stopped working so I switched to Seroquel. At low doses it was ineffective, however now I'm taking 600mg at night it has worked well. At this dose, after a couple of days I felt like myself again. I've noticed some drowsiness but in my experience with antipsychotics it will fade as I become acclimated to it. However, I am extremely hungry all of the time. Hopefully this will go away.",0,63,22

My family did not know when I would have a mood swing.  Worse than that, neither did I!  I find that with seroquel I am able to think rationally and act appropriately.

I am now able to fully analyze a thought process and decide whether or not to act on it. I have noticed a profound change in all areas of my life including my musical abilities.

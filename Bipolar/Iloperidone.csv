"Iloperidone","nicolelett","May 29, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Fanapt is my fourth medication since September when I was finally diagnosed with Bipolar 2. Abilify, Latuda, and geodon made me feel like I wanted to come out of my skin. I was misdiagnosed for years. But this medication, in addition to my treatment plan, has completely changed my life. It did make me quite edgy at first and I still felt unstable, so my doctor added Lithium last week to my Paxil,Lamictal,and Fanapt. I am feeling better than I have ever felt. I feel truly alive for the first time in my life. I go to counseling every week and I haven't missed one appointment since I started in September. So I'm doing my part as well. Thank God for therapy and medication!",10,6,1
"Iloperidone","Gusto23","February 27, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Bipolar depression diagnosed and have tried Abilify, Geodon, Respirdal. all made me uneasy inside. Like I couldn't stop moving or like I needed to because my mind kept telling me to. I just couldn't sit still, watch tv, or worst part I couldn't sit through Sunday Mass. Doctor put me on 2mg of Fanapt and its like I should've been on it all along. I can do all the stuff I want to do and not slip so deep into a depression. Also, he gave me a voucher that pays $200.00 per prescription so my copay is exactly $4.65. It's also good for a whole year. I was paying $50  on all the other stuff.",10,7,1
"Iloperidone","John Q Logan","April 10, 2015","-","the Fanapt has eased my mood swings considerably but alone it wasn't enough since I am such a rapid cycler topomax was added as well and I feel that without these medications I would more than likely have been turned into an incoherent babbling idiot by the pharmaceutical list I was on before",10,8,1
"Iloperidone","Anonymous","January 10, 2015","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I am on a small dose of this to help me with anxiety that brintellix doesn't alleviate. Only 0.5 mg.dose but it does the trick. Insurance covers it but I still need to pay about $150 out of pocket each month. I wish it wasn't so expensive.",9,5,1
"Iloperidone","buddygrl","December 12, 2014","-","<b>Fanapt (iloperidone):</b>			 At first I thought it was helpful because I want to remain open and optimistic, I do think the medication helped with some anxiety.  The side effects for me were so negative.  It became very clear once off the Fanapt how the side effects were adversely impacting me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain as a result of taking Fanapt.  I can deal with a little anxiety.  My other medications take care of that Lamictal and  Topamax.  Fanapt side effects outweigh the benefits for me.  Yoga and breathing exercises and mindful meditation.  Also the restlessness and dry nasal passage ways and feeling that I had to constantly have to move and shuffling of my feet as well as the long term possible tardive dyskinesia.",0,21,1
"Iloperidone","tpdgmashley","April 1, 2014","-","I began taking Fanapt back in December of 2013 as recommended a psychiatrist when in the psych ward getting my anti-psychotic med readjusted. It works good. I won't say great because I have not had any more problems since taking it. I have a couple side effects that are listed. but would get them anyway either due to my brain injury or other medications that I take.",10,3,1
"Iloperidone","acrkb2","December 5, 2013","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I'm a 22 year old guy who went on Fanapt about 8 months ago for bipolar disorder. I'm pretty sure it helped me function in college again, calmed me down, stabilized my mood. The one problem was it demolished most of my sexual functioning: I completely lost the ability to ejaculate, could rarely get and keep an erection, and had significantly less sex drive. I have been talking to my psychiatrist about going off Fanapt soon because I don't think it is worth the sexual side effects.",7,4,1
"Iloperidone","Anonymous","February 5, 2012","-","<b>Fanapt (iloperidone):</b>			 Fanapt was the third medication I tried to treat mood swings associated with Bipolar Disorder.  It has worked wonders for me!  It decreased my emotional reactivity so that I am able to perform well at work.  I have less anxiety and my hypomanic episodes are not only fewer, but also less intense.   I really wish that it was less expensive, though.  My insurance will not cover it and even if it did, it is so expensive that it would consume more than half of my annual benefit allotment.  I hope I can find a way to continue taking it.  It has made such a difference for me.",0,47,1
"Iloperidone","Anonymous","November 9, 2011","-","I have Bipolar I disorder and have been on Seroquel, Geodon and now Fanapt. It has worked wonders for me and the only side effect I have is a stuffy nose. Life is brighter, stable and I can laugh now. You will pry Fanapt out of my cold, dead hands!",10,12,1

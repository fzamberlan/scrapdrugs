"Clonazepam","Greatful","March 2, 2020","-","I have bipolar and am a rapid cycler, every 2 weeks. Take depakote daily, and 1 mg klonopin at night.  Since my cycle is  predictable, I take 1 extra 1 mg klonopin 2 days before my cycle starts and it prevents me from going up. I am really tired the next day, but worth it.  1/4 klonopin under tongue helps me with panic attacks, especially in traffic.",10,6,1

"Clonazepam","Marissa K.","March 13, 2018","-","Since a teenager I was thought to be just depressed (2 suicide attempts and months in hospitals). I spent my early years on Welbutren(sp?) at 18 after another episode, I was switched to Zoloft.  I stayed on that for almost 2 years, but would go from feeling  nothing at all, to pacing in my room not able to sleep for days.  Scared to death about everything.  After I’d come out of these phases, that some times lasted months, I would sit back and be embarrassed for all my outrageous actions (quitting colleges, acquiring far too many ferrets, because I honestly believed they’d save me, only wearing one outfit but insisting to do my laundry every day etc...)  Finally at the age of 24 I was prescribed Klonopin.  .05 mg up to 3 Times a day.  90 a month.  Suddenly I could sleep again.  I didn’t believe in mysterious rituals, I could actually hold down a job.  I was diagnosed with Bipolar depression and got prescribed Klonopin paired with lexapro.  It has literally been life changing.",9,19,1

After taking citalopram for 12 years for what doc thought was regular depression, I went off that and now searching for mood stabilizer for bipolar moods.   Clonazapam 0.5 2x daily helped stabilize my anxiety after all of this and Ativan 0.5 as needed for panic attacks.  Clonazapam is great because it stays in your system much longer than Ativan.

"Clonazepam","Randazzle :)","July 8, 2016","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been taking Klonopin, on and off, for almost ten years now. There are so many varieties that I don't know which ones work for me anymore. The doctors all tell you it's the same thing. If that's the case, why have I stopped and started so many times? The most common reason is tolerance, i suspect. However, it has been my observation over the last 10 or so years, that the different colors, sources, and whatever fillers that are in some of these clonazepam, alter the effects too randomly. As sufferers of the horribly misunderstood disorder, we should have more resources to find out what is in these and  more insight into which ones favor our individual bipolar characteristics.",6,17,1

For one with BPD, Bipolar, and Anxiety Attacks, this pill is a godsend.  I usually do not advocate pharmaceuticals, but I have never had my anxiety quelled like klonopin does.  It is highly effective for any type of anxiety, and stops panic in its tracks after 15-20 mins of administering. This is the only pill that i'm on that I advocate.  The only warning I have is that it has high potential for dependence, and the body gets used to having it constantly.  Sometimes it requires upping the dosage.  PLEASE start on 0.5 mg.  If your dr starts you on 1mg, it will bring on extreme fatigue, and decreased motor function.",10,29,1

I suffered alot from Anxiety or panic attacks and i must say that Klonopin has been the best drug i have ever had, even better than Xanax. It relaxes me instead of that sedation feeling Xanax used to give me and also last longer. I can now sleep better as well.

"Clonazepam","kemikalboi","May 31, 2011","-","<b>Klonopin (clonazepam):</b>			 I have been on Klonopin for over 6 yrs now.  Has been working great. I take it for Bipolar Disorder and Panic Disorder without agoraphobia.  I have had my times off of it, but also experiencing Epilepsy. I usually  have seizures within 48 hrs of being off Klonopin.  Needless to say I'm still taking it (0.5mg tabs 4 times daily).  Works great, and it was the first benzodiazepine I've been prescribed and only one that works for me.  I've tried Ativan, Xanax, Valium and Restoril. They all work great, but I'll always prefer Klonopin.",0,28,3

"Clonazepam","Anonymous","September 12, 2009","-","3 years after being diagnosed with Bipolar 1, I was put on 2 mg of Rivotril to be taken at night following a car accident. When it was prescribed, I was in a poor state of mental health and was suffering from extreme agitation and horrible nightmares. After taking clonazepam for a while, I noticed that not only did it calm agitation, but it helped stabilize my mood. It has made my mood more consistent and improved it dramatically. I consistently feel calm, positive, and mentally stable. I've been prescribed other benzodiazepines in the past, but clonazepam has by far been the most effective. Overall, an excellent medication also considering that it isn't subject to metabolite accumulation.",10,14,3

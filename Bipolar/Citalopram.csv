"Citalopram","Kiwi","December 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Citalopram is the Best medicine ever! Keeps me so stable and I feel so levelled out. I have anxiety and depression followed by bipolar and I just feel like I can go by my day to day life normal. They make me feel giddy and happier and alive.",10,15,1
"Citalopram","Chief Bromden","January 26, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Went off this med pre Christmas under Drs orders. Went quite crazy over Christmas. Reintroduced  2 days ago and finally I'm coming down. I'm on lithium and pristiq but even as much 20mg daily has made a huge difference so far. I have a new Dr. now.",10,6,1
"Citalopram","Meli","May 21, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Bipolar II, anxiety, panic, GAD, and MDD. On my 2nd day on citalopram. I can feel the difference instantly. Odd, but true.  I felt instantly calm and giddy.  Unusual happy. Which is a strange feeling for me but it’s a good feeling.  Different taste bud now.  I noticed I’m eating less now.  Not nauseous but I can feel something else in my stomach like you're not really that hungry. Eat to live.   Less lethargic too. Less lazy feeling.  So hopefully in a few weeks I’ll be feeling super energetic.   Only 2 bad side effects are IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) the toilet becomes ur best friend (Don’t try to pass gas or you'll shart in your pants.  Lol),  and restless at  bedtime. Couldn’t sleep all night. I took med in mornings.    Will come back in a few weeks to report.",8,17,1
"Citalopram","Candy2015*#","January 20, 2018","-","Best drug I've ever taken and I've tried many. It started working right away after a few weeks. I also have anxiety, bad PMS, and some OCD features. I have no side effects except for initial diarrhea. I also take it with Welbutrin and have had no problems. My best friend said it worked well for her for 3 or 4 years until it stopped working; I hope it never stops working for me.",10,6,1
"Citalopram","Dave87538","September 24, 2017","-","Had severe depression and anxiety for years.  20 mg was good for depression 40 mg was good for depression and anxiety.  Been on 40mg a year now and am amazed at how much better I feel.  I wish I had started something years ago.",9,10,1
"Citalopram","gotskates","July 26, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I have been on a lot of psychotropic drugs through the years.  I hated them all.  This was the first drug that relieved my anxiety and my mind doesn't work as fast so I can actually focus on something and read without all the inner dialogue in my head.  When I am trying to read something, my mind takes off on tangents and I am still reading but I am not comprehending.  It's nice to be able to focus on something and really take in the information.  I don't feel like I'm in such a hurry all the time.  I personally didn't have ANY problem with my libido or with my orgasms.  For men, it's good you can last longer when taking this medication;)  My boyfriend takes it also.",10,13,1
"Citalopram","HarryDD","November 11, 2016","-","My life has been a disaster.  Recently diagnosed with bipolar, spent most of my life aware of something wrong, but unaware of what it was and mostly unaware of how I affected others.  Started citalopram a year ago, and caught fleeting glances of my condition. Then figured out that why my life has been such a bucket of poo, even though on paper I had accomplished a great deal.  No matter what I did, where I went, the sick I was always there.  Have tried other cures but they didn't work as well as citalopram.  Lithium helped some.  Others left my mouth dry (very bad for the teeth), gave me headaches, and made my heart race.  So here I am,  having to cuddle with a dragon and a psychic one at that.",8,17,1
"Citalopram","O K Here Abouts","November 4, 2015","-","It knocks out extreme sadness for me. But I still get the lack of motivation and energy when it comes around. I'm bipolar 1.",10,14,1
"Citalopram","WhichMed","October 2, 2015","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was originally prescribed this for Major Depressive Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. At 20mg it didn't help at all, but once raised to 40mg and combined with an anti-psychotic (to prevent manic episodes) it worked well for 5 - 6 months. Unfortunately it stopped working completely, quite out of the blue, and neither myself, other half or medical professionals could figure out why. It was a shame as  I had virtually no side-effects on this medication, just some 'bruxing' (teeth grinding) at night, but not to the point where my jaw ached or anything.",7,17,1
"Citalopram","polar queen","January 5, 2015","-","It's worked well with Topamax and if needed Xanax. The best combination. Since I was diagnosed bipolar at 15. Withdrawals are bad if I forget to take it.",9,12,1
"Citalopram","scoobiemobile","September 27, 2012","Taken for 2 to 5 years","It calms me sometimes but my sex life is not there. It helps me sleep but I still have daily ups and downs lighter but not gone, never know what my day will be still. Thoughts have not gone at all.",4,29,1
"Citalopram","Killer Whales","September 29, 2011","-","<b>Celexa (citalopram):</b>			 Celexa worked really well for me, in terms of stabilizing my mood. I actually felt really happy and thought with clarity for once! But I had to stop taking it because the side effects are just extremely unpleasant. I wasn't able to achieve an erection and if I did I wasn't able to orgasm. I also had this sedated like feeling. My body temperature would increase. But I also felt emotionless at the same time if that makes any sense. I found it hard to respond to my partners emotions. Everything was just on a cloud for me. Someone could have insulted me and I would have been alright with it.",0,60,1

"Geodon","Grace","May 10, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've had a very similar experience to the last post. Began taking Geodon for Bipolar disorder 1 and felt cured, energetic, happy. My depression was gone, as was my anxiety and I had much better work ethic. Fast forward a few weeks and the effects are subsiding. I upped my dose to 60mg but it's still not the same as initially. I've had some pretty low points. I'm hoping it still works to prevent manic episodes despite not having the antidepressant effects any longer. Considering switching to latuda, or adding an SSRI/SNRI to the mix.",5,1,1
"Geodon","RJ","April 30, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","At first taking Geodon it was great, felt alive for the first time in so, so many years it was for my major depression disorder.  Then after three weeks of taking it, it stopped working.  Now increasing to 40 mg daily.  I’m hoping that works but kinda nervous it’s not going to.  Just my experience for taking it for 3 going on 4 weeks.  The side effects I had were nausea, lack of appetite, shaking and some vision issues.  Side effects seem to be subsiding.",5,4,1

"Geodon","bernie2020","February 6, 2020","-","I’ve been on this med Geodon for about a year for bipolar and bpd. I am on a dose of 160 mg and I take it all at night. I still have mania symptoms but the only symptom I have is not sleeping. A couple of weeks ago I was up for 60 hours non stop and this past week I've been getting 3-4 hours of sleep and have felt fully energized. The first time I took this medication I slept from 8pm to 5pm and was groggy for the 4 hours. I was awake before I went back to bed. I haven’t been tired because of it since, though. I also developed an acute dystonic reaction called an  oculogyric crisis  because of this med. I am on amandatine to stop it. This med has been a game changer for me despite this. I don’t get severely depressed anymore and my depressive episodes would be really terrible and my manic episodes would always end me up in the hospital because I'd go on a bender and overdose or I'd be up for days and be extremely irritable and cranky.",8,6,1
"Geodon","Anonymous","February 3, 2020","-","Three years ago I was put on Geodon for auditory hallucinations. It has been the only antipsychotic medication I have ever used that has no side effects and no weight gain, and I sleep like a baby at night. 80 mgs at bedtime is all I take. This drug has totally changed my life for the better, and has blessed me in a hundred ways. I felt so much better after my first month on it that I went out and got a job at McDonalds restaurant and have been in management there as a trainer for the last three years. This drug has been a huge success with me when all others failed and I plan to take it for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend it at low doses to anyone. The higher doses cause horrible dizziness, so the lower doses work better. I have not heard a single voice in three years and Geodon has made a believer out of me. Bravo!",10,28,1
"Geodon","Lobo","January 25, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been on geodon for several months now. I take it twice a day. So far, I have had no side effects whatsoever! It has really helped with my bipolar symptoms. I am calmer and clearer. I was scared to start it because of all the negative reviews. I finally decided to go ahead and take it. No sleepiness, no muscle stiffness, no anything! Just feel so much better! Haven't had any major depression, or psychotic episodes, or anger issues. I also take lamotrigine once a day. Great combo! Life is finally looking up for me! Been on all sorts of different meds. This is working for me! Very happy about the results!",10,13,1
"Geodon","Ran S","January 16, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I had bad mania and needed to be on something. I couldn't go to sleep, crazy focused on everything and felt so scattered. My doctor recommended Geodon, and it worked for the first 2 months, but then it gave me horrible anxiety. I had to get off it and get on an anti-anxiety. I also had some bad side effects from Geodon- lots of vomiting and nausea, cravings, and anxiety.",2,6,1
"Geodon","Pretty Good","January 10, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","Geodon has consistently blocked auditory hallucinations for me for 13 1/2 years.  However, I ended up with ulcers that landed me in the emergency room about 6 years in.  After that everything went well until about 11 years in I began to develop what turned into about 10 side effects &amp; a few were serious.  Tried a side effect med and it worked for about 9 months.  Sadly, I'm looking for an alternative.  Sadly because Geodon carries almost no risk of Parkinson's which is a terminal illness",8,6,1
"Geodon","A","December 13, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This drug caused SEVERE muscle stiffness. Every muscle in my body, including my jaw was tight as tight can be. Subsequently I couldn't sleep because of this.",1,12,1
"Geodon","Insomniac Too","November 17, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I've been on this medication for years. My doctor prescribed me Geodon because I was really depressed and suicidal. At one point I was taking 160mg (two pills) a day, but it's been reduced to 80mg (one pill) a day. No drowsiness (I take it with dinner and I can drive on it just fine). No sadness. No suicidal thoughts. I don't have any complaints about brain fog either.  I was in a really bad place, where it took everything just to go to the appointment and admit I needed something changed. I did notice it messed with my menstrual cycle though? I've read that could happen, talked with my doctor, and the dose was lowered from 100mg to the current 80mg. Problem solved.",10,19,1
"Geodon","mag n cheese","November 15, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I've been on Geodon for several years now. After trying seemingly every medication as well as ECT, this combined with Lamictal finally seemed to even my bipolar out. However, it's not perfect and I still have periods of mania and depression when I mess with my dose. I'm currently thinking about switching antipsychotics, mostly because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms I get each morning and night before my next dose. Mostly bad nausea and vomiting almost every day. I also go through periods where I literally cannot stay awake because of this medication (falling asleep in the hallways of my college classes, and while driving). Overall, it has helped me tremendously but the combination of side effects, withdrawals, and still having manic symptoms is causing me to think about other options.",6,9,1
"Geodon","Not for me","November 14, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","Ziprasidone made me feel like a zombie. It made me really tired all day. I had a hard time waking up and carrying out my daily activities. I am not sure whether it helped me with controlling mania. Also, it made my vision really blurry and dry. I had a hard time seeing things literally.",1,6,1
"Geodon","Geonot","November 2, 2019","-","Can’t say too much  as I was on Geodon maybe 3 weeks. However during that time I felt like I was seeing life through a bizarre perspective. I had no control over my voice levels and was yelling without realizing it. I think I almost walked into traffic. I remember being at a meeting and felt high and disjointed in thought. Couldn’t take the akasthasia. That’s about it. That was enough for me. Surreal. I currently don’t take any anti psychotics so that I can work and support my family which I have been doing now for several years.  Been off them for years. And that was the secret to my success.",1,15,1
"Geodon","Jen","October 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I take one 20 mg capsule every night. I have borderline personality disorder. Before starting this I never slept and this medication helps me sleep. I had some side effects when I started taking it. I was sick to my stomach, throwing up and wasn't able to keep any food down. This lasted a bit over two weeks. I've been on this medication for a few months now and it's helped me with mood and sleep. I take Prozac 40mg as well.",10,16,1
"Geodon","Gia","September 23, 2019","-","I've been taking Geodon for years and now take the generic Ziprasidone. I can't tell any differences and are unremarkable. It has NOT made me gain weight and that is one reason I started taking this particular antipsychotic. I sleep like a rock but am a little groggy when I first wake up but that goes away pretty fast. The only really remarkable slide affect is my emotions or lack there of. I have total radical acceptance on most issues in life. I'm never overly happy or overly sad. I'm just on cruise control and it takes a lot to make me angry. It has definitely slowed down my rapid cycling which I'm very grateful for. I am glad my doctor put me on this medication. It has literally been a lifesaver for me.",10,31,1
"Geodon","Lo","September 7, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started taking this medication for my mania. I really didn’t notice a difference in my manic episodes while on it. At night the ziprasidone would make me uncomfortably drowsy, and even then I would be unable to sleep through the whole night. On nights where I barely slept, I would wake up so terribly drowsy that I couldn’t keep my eyes open. This impaired my driving and made work and school really difficult if not impossible. My manic episodes remained the same, until I tried stopping the ziprasidone, in which they became alarmingly worse than I’d ever had them before. One night without taking ziprasidone, I had a major manic episode and was awake for over 36 hours. I was only able to rest after taking the ziprasidone, but could only sleep 9 hours after being awake for so long. I’m still trying to get off the ziprasidone, but I’m unsure how to do this without sacrificing an entire nights sleep and my sanity.",1,7,1
"Geodon","Aflynn","August 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I absolutely hate this medication. I either feel numb or like it has dulled my personality. I feel anxious and restless on it. It really does nothing to help my mood swings.",3,10,1
"Geodon","random_nickname","August 21, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on Geodon and Depakote a dozen years ago for a few months. The whole time I was on Geodon I was so down on myself. It's a terrible drug. They gave me Klonopin for the anxiety caused by Geodon, but that made me fall asleep all the time, so I couldn't keep taking it. It gave me a blank, vacuous expression, too.",1,6,1
"Geodon","Rottiemom23","August 6, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I started taking this one week ago. I am taking it for bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder (not sure about complete diagnosis yet. + insomnia. It has helped me sleep. The only thing is the side effects that come with it. I started taking it on a Wednesday and I started feeling sick Thursday. I have felt sick every day for a week. Nausea, throwing up, diarrhea. I have been on a lot of medications and I really want something that will work so how long do I go on with the side effects hoping they will disappear? Will the side effects eventually go away?",5,5,1
"Geodon","Anonymous","August 3, 2019","-","I was on this drug years ago when it was cover by a manufacturer patient plan, when they discontinued the plan I had to go off the drug because it had been cost prohibitive. Since then and many psych meds later my life a been a constant state of flux. My doctor is putting me back on Geodon, now that I have PART D. I couldn't be happier.",10,9,1
"Geodon","Dimitri","August 1, 2019","-","Worse anti psychotic ever. The first week of taking it was ok. It would give me the munchies but I wouldn’t eat so I didn’t gain weight ( btw if you get the munchies and you control it you won’t gain any weight. I was always on Zyprexa for years and I ignored the munchies and I maintained slim). Anyways, Geodon would make me sleepy and I was able to sleep on it. Then after a couple of weeks I was feeling so restless, I couldn’t sit still and was moving a lot and I hated that side effect. Then all of a sudden it would make me feel wired and I wouldn’t sleep well for days. Then one day I took the medication earlier and a couple hours later I had a severe panic attack that I almost called the ambulance. Never again will I ever take Geodon. This stuff reacts as a stimulant. I’ve been happy on Zyprexa and seroquel. Just exercise and control your diet and you’ll be fine.",1,4,1
"Geodon","Mary","July 15, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I took Geodon for one year. While this drug did increase my motivation to exercise, I felt the side effects were too negative to continue using. It ruined my personality for some reason and interfered with my ability to make quick, witty jokes like I am normally able to do when not taking this med. For that reason, I did not like it because it turned me into a robotic, unemotional Stepford wife or something. It gave me such severe anxiety that I had frequent panic attacks and had to be treated with an anti-anxiety med to counteract the negative side effects of the Geodon. It made me have to frequently urinate or feel like I had to go at least every 20 minutes. If you want to flatline your personality, have severely agitated anxiety, and spend your life in the bathroom, take this drug.",6,14,1
"Geodon","fixxcer2019","July 7, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","DO not take geodon, I cannot stress this enough. it's a terrible drug. for me it caused loss of appetite, bloating and easy bruising. when you come off of the drug it caused severe withdrawal such as brain fog, depression and flu like symptoms.",1,6,1
"Geodon","LJ","July 2, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was on Latuda &amp; Lamictal &amp; was still having major irritability; I could feel the mania trying to breakthrough. My psych kept me on the Lamictal but switched me to Geodon. Within a day I could feel a difference. I no longer had the rage that had been bubbling under the surface for weeks  it had died down. I have rapid cycling Bipolar 1 but mania is my biggest problem.  The only side effect I’m having is a hard time falling asleep. For sleep I take gabapentin, trazodone &amp; last night I added in some benadryl to be safe. I’m sleeping 8 hours &amp; waking up without an alarm but I’m now foggy in the morning. But, halfway through my second cup of coffee I’m fine and awake. I’m on 20mg twice a day &amp; I’m hoping my psych will add in a third dose mid day because I feel like it’s wearing off a couple of hours before I take my evening dose. Overall I think Geodon is working for me &amp; I’m glad I gave it a try. Being angry all the time is exhausting.",9,25,1
"Geodon","Heymelisser","June 24, 2019","-","Been on Geodon over 2 yrs with lamictal for Bipolar 1 disorder.  Handled mania well for year at 120 mg of Geodon once a night. Summer came extreme mania hit and now take olazapine only when feeling nuttier than usual. Haven't been experienced extreme mania over a year now and take 120 mg Geodon once at night. Causes low libido for me and clonazepam daily needed for bad anxiety. Give it an 8.5",8,9,1
"Geodon","Brian","June 21, 2019","-","I started Geodon a few months ago. I like it much better than Abilify which I was previously on. Prior to Geodon I was waking up at 3:00 am 3-4 nights per week. Since I have been on Geodon I  consistently sleep through the night. Geodon is a great adjunct to Lithium. They together really quell my Mania. Overall Geodon is a great medication in my opinion.",10,17,2
"Geodon","Dani","April 27, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was placed on Geodon while inpatient for Bipolar 1, rapid cycling, dysphoric mixed episodes. It helped within a few days and the dysphoria, rapid cycling and mixed state stopped. I take 40 mg at dinner and it starts to mellow me out and drowsiness kicks in at bedtime and I am ready to sleep. Works wonders because sedatives were not helping my insomnia. This has helped me maintain a healthy sleep schedule. I wake up refreshed and remain focused throughout the day. I have lost weight on Geodon as it seems to be suppressing my appetite, but after med after med that made me gain weight I am ok with this side effect. I have had zero side effects from this med thankfully, but know some people that do. I would say it either works great or it doesn’t. Everyone’s brain chemistry is different so that is probably why. If it doesn’t work for you, hang in there. I hope that you find something as effective as this has been for me.",10,37,2

The first dose was like something out of a nightmare.  I felt extremely drowsy, but anxious. Worst anxiety I have ever felt. Everything made me anxious.

"Geodon","Sikkinixx","December 3, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I'd rate this a 10 but I am still fairly new to it and don't want to be overly optimistic.  However my life has turned completely around on this medication.  I did have a negative side effect that cause uncontrollable face and tongue movements but once the dosage was adjusted and another medication called cogentin, added to it, those movements have gone away. It was like night and day and I didn't have to wait weeks to feel different. There is a euphoria that comes with it , a sense of well being. It's helped my bipolar symptoms regarding concentration,  mood, sleep and over all well being. Yes I know many don't have a pleasant experience with anti or atypical psychotic drugs but for some of us it can really change your life. If the pros outweigh the cons then I'm down to keep using this medication.  I take it with lithium and this is the best I've felt in the 15 years that I've been diagnosed as bipolar.",8,24,2

My neurologist actually diagnosed me with Parkinson’s, drug induced.  Pale skin, stone face never smiled or showed expression, my tongue would be sticking out and I had no clue.  I stumbled and fell often.  My daughter researched it in College and her Psycopharmacology professor told her how bad it was.  Took me 2 months to be weaned off.

Before Geodon I attempted suicide several times starting when when I was 14 yo. I tried to get help all the time, but nobody listened. Finally out of desperation I found a psychiatrist who recognized what was wrong with me and put me on Geodon, 80 msg, always at bedtime. I also started therapy, for a year, and my life turned around!! Until about a year ago. Maybe 15 months! I started spending money, hiding it from my family! I am now almost $30 thousand in debt it is compulsive spending! And I can’t stop! Also, I can’t wake up! Even when one of my kids come and tries, they can’t wake me!

I was given geodon two months ago when I was hospitalized for mixed episodes. If you've never had one I pray you never do. Geodon stopped the episode after one dose.  If you experience sleepiness ask your doctor if you can take it in one dose at dinner. Also when reading reviews remember that at some doses it is sedating and at others energizing. For me it has been weight neutral in fact I've lost weight while on it. YMMV (your mileage may vary) good luck finding something that works for you.",9,20,2

I started to wake up at night half asleep, eating and doing really weird things.  I tapered off over a few months because stopping cold turkey causes me extreme mental withdrawal.

Not only did it MAKE me act bi-polar,  I also had full body tremors 24/7, heart palpitations and tachycardia  (mainly at bedtime). The last episode lasted 3 hour's.  I iced my body (to lower core temperature), took very deep breaths and massaged the main artery, left side of the neck. I was about to call 911 when it finally stopped.

Also, I gave a girlfriend a ride home and she told me I was driving awfully and it kind of scared her.

"Geodon","Anonymous","August 3, 2011","-","I've taken Geodon for the past year and it's the best thing that has ever happened to me.  It gave me my life back.  I no longer bounce between mania and depression.  The best thing is that I can sleep at night.  I had never experienced a good night's sleep until this medicine was prescribed for me.  I didn't even know it.  While I do miss the mania, I feel much more stable and well.  I eventually got used to the drowsy feeling and it's mild now.  My only wish is that I didn't have to ingest the calories for it to work.  Sometime I would like to have a salad for dinner but can't because it's not enough calories.  That is my only complaint.  This is a great medication that changed my life for the better.",10,28,7
"Geodon","forgetful32","July 24, 2011","-","I have been on Geodon for 3 years now, and I like it better than other bipolar medicines! But the downside is I forget things really easy, and also I can't remember things from years ago like I should. People tell me things I have no idea what they are talking about. I manic every once in a while, I take 60mg in mornings and 60mg at bedtime. It hasn't gave me trouble with my heart, and my blood pressure stays great. I hope this helps. I am trying to cope with it without changing medicines.",10,19,7

I have been diagnosed with chronic depression for over 16 years now and I have tried everything out there but with Lamictal and Geodon along with gabapentin and Xanax I have finally found the right combination. Without the gabapentin I have found that I can't get moving without it. It really works for me. I am bipolar and have been all my life. Being depressed has affected every part of my life and I mean every aspect. I feel that bipolar is highly underrated. It is debilitating and causes you to make so many wrong choices in life but I have been fortunate to find my husband.",0,41,7

I have had positive results I was beginning to think were not possible. It actually seems to have an antidepressant effect and with my designation (I have Bipolar I with psychotic features) I am allowed no other antidepressants except Lamictal which doesn't do much. Just thought I would post this for someone else who might be in my shoes. ",10,88,7

I can't even make it through a grocery store without feeling the uncontrollable need to sleep.

I was diagnosed bipolar although I believe I may be schizoaffective instead, due to the classification guidelines I have read. But this medicine is amazing. I gave it a P because the only negative effect I have experienced was sleepiness but Adderall or Provigil fixes that and I have become so much more willing to do things and have fun with life rather than just be in a negative mood all the time, or become agitated with people.",9,46,8

I slept a full 8 hours and felt completely refreshed and ready to go when I woke in the morning. Then at a dosage of 80mg, instead of putting me gently to sleep, it gave me waves of paralysis in my whole body and had me hysterically crying for my daddy and hallucinating.

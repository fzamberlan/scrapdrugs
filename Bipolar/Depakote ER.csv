"Depakote ER","DebiAvi","April 7, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I was diagnosed with Bipolar I, forty years ago. On Lithium first. Made me worse. Treated with over 30 drugs, all made me worse, before realizing Depakote ONLY was the Med for me. A doc explained to me that folks who lean towards mania should not take anti-depressants. Hindsight! Then, after years of Benzo’s PRN, I started experiencing interdose withdrawals that wrecked my entire immune system. NEVER take Benzo’s!!! Trying to get off of them almost killed me. I got down to 95 pounds. Also, coming off of them is DANGEROUS! Must be done SLOWLY under the guidance of a medical professional who is experienced with the withdrawal risks and tapering schedules. Google the CNN Lisa Ling special. Now with anything I try one new medicine at a time under close medical supervision. Then I know what it does FOR and TO me. Less is more. After years of being on various cocktails, Depakote alone is best for me.",8,8,1
"Depakote ER","Blaise","March 28, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Wonder drug for me, although I only use it as a rescue med if I get an inkling of mania. I don’t take it all the time because I gain weight and the hair loss is devastating. The upside is that it gives me curly hair (which also hides some of the hair loss). I lose about 50% of my hair volume. The curls slowly relax once I stop taking it. I still had waves two years after I stopped taking it full time. It’s the oddest thing.  In addition to adding it as a rescue med, My doctor and I have carefully put together a drug cocktail that works for me. Effexor XR, Risperdal and bupropion. I don’t feel over medicated and it took years to get the formula right. Never stop trying new meds if you aren’t getting good results.",9,4,1
"Depakote ER","Generic Name","January 24, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Starting dose of 250mg in the morning and 500mg at night keeps me in therapeutic range, and very effectively controls my bipolar type II with mixed episode, but even with 20mg Adderall extended release, I find my self incredibly drowsy and groggy in the morning. Unfortunately, this medication just doesn't agree with my brain chemistry, and I'm hoping to switch to lamictal soon.",4,1,1
"Depakote ER","Mood Swing Mama","October 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I must start off by saying everyone is different and will react different. My condition is unofficially diagnosed. But I was told when I was a teenager I was a maniac depressive with possible hormonal imbalance. Recently I have had two major mania events. Accelerated heart rate, palpitations, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, mood swings, confusion, and memory loss to name a few. The night I took this medication I felt it kick in. I felt great and had so much mental energy I didn't have before. It has been working for me. I suggest eating when you take this medication it can make you nauseous. I haven't seen any  side effects other than that. Each to their own though. Just wanted to post this to this forum to let you know if this doesn't work for you there is a medication that will work. Don't give up !",8,24,1
"Depakote ER","Abbey","September 14, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was prescribed Depakote for mood stability with the benefit of possible migraine control. I noticed the slightest amount of difference in impulsivity, but looking back it was most likely due to other medication changes at the time. We increased the dose hoping for better results, but all  I received was side effects. I took one dose at night and the increased dose just made me incredibly ‘loopy’ and I wasn’t able to move properly as my body was incredibly weak. On the higher dose, the fact I wasn’t able to get out of bed without falling over and emotional mood swings made the slight benefits just not worth it. Once stopping the medication, I figured out that Depakote had increased the ringing in my ears (which luckily improved dramatically after a few months of not taking it). One benefit of this medication was that it was extremely easy to use, and if your body is able to tolerate it is absolutely worth giving it a go. After all, you never know until you try it!",3,5,1
"Depakote ER","dave","July 20, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","have been taking Depakote 1500 mg for 2 years, find it calms me down, when anxiety is overwhelming. It is worth side effects  of weight gain, and hair loss. I keep taking regular dose and don't play around dosage.",8,14,1
"Depakote ER","JB34","June 10, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Not sure if Depakote is worth it. Rather take Seroquel XR.",6,4,1
"Depakote ER","SF100","October 2, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I am a guy who underwent 30 yrs of treatment for anxiety/depression until I was finally correctly diagnosed with BP2 and ADHD. Depakote ER 2000mg at night is my mainstay med. My default mixed states are well-controlled by Depakote. Xanax works as a rescue med at far lower doses than I took before Depakote. Early hair loss (now resolved), no weight gain. I take 20mg Dexedrine daily for ADHD; Depakote doesn't let it trigger hypomania. Ketamine infusions &amp; nose spray cover the depressive side.",10,18,1
"Depakote ER","Alt jay","September 17, 2018","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I have had three severe manic episodes in my lifetime.  First was not diagnosed.  The 2nd severe mania hit in 02 and I was given zyprexa.  This took the edge off but I would wake up in the early morning manic again, once it wore off.  When depakote was added, I really came down.  I was Manic-episode free 15 yrs, w/ relapse in ‘17.  I was put on zyprexa and lithium but was still flying high and fast - complete manic.  Once high dose of depakote added, I came down for good.  This drug has been critical for resolving my manias.  My experience with it for long term treatment has not been good though - lost a lot of hair, and a lot of enthusiasm and felt like I was in a stupor.  I gained weight, but that has happened on all the useful drugs.",8,13,1
"Depakote ER","K","May 12, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Terrible. Absolute poison. I would never  ever put that toxic waste in my blood stream again. Depakote is bad.",1,9,1
"Depakote ER","Carala","April 4, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I am very pleased so far with my experience taking Depakote. Before Depakote, I was taking seroquel for quite some time (a couple years) and although I was happy on that medicine, I was way too tired. Luckily my solution was Depakote. All I can say is I have tried medicine for 4 years now and it has been a long journey! I will always remember my first time taking Depakote. Normally I get very fearful and panic the med will make me sick. Not Depakote. Instead, I felt immediately better, happy even, and giggled. Once that wore off, I felt normal and slept an hour or two after taking it. I enjoy how I still get tired on this medication like seroquel, but it does not overwhelm my senses with sedation, and fog my memory as much. If anything, I have never been more myself! Only thing is now sometimes I laugh too much.",10,32,1
"Depakote ER","Madoline","December 4, 2017","-","I have been on generic Depakote for 12 years.  Prior to it, I took lithium for 28 years.   On Depakote, I lost 30 pounds; and did not have hair loss.  I do get tired in the afternoon and take a nap.  I feel the medication helps me live a good life.  I believe I would be dead without medication that keeps me from being manic.",9,26,1
"Depakote ER","J2 Gal","December 1, 2017","-","I'm going to say this. This medication has been a lifesaver for me. I've been on it for six months now. I take it for migraines, bipolar, and seizures.  No noticeable side effects except for a lot of ear popping. I am a lot calmer than what I used to be. My anxiety is still there but it isn't as bad as it was. I can actually function on this medication. My family can be around me now.  I used to rapid cycle and have mixed episodes at least ten times a week. Now they're gone. It's nice to be normal for a change. No grandiose delusions. No audible delusions. I am a little bit sleepier than normal. But with a change of diet, I'm okay. No hair falling out. Just the normal hair loss when it comes to the change of weather.",10,23,1
"Depakote ER","chew chew","October 14, 2017","Taken for 10 years or more","I take non generic Depakote ER 1750 mg?? Haldol 4 mg, and propranolol 20 mg.  I have some hair loss, insomnia, and shakiness.  I believe the medicine is finally working after 17 years of trying every bipolar medication with Depakote ER.  I lose my patience and get angry at customer service representatives sometimes.  I lose my patience and get mildly angry at my husband but it appears to be under control.  The insomnia at times gets really bad and I wind up calling lifenet to cope.  I will be trying melatonin 3mg to see if this helps.  I want to try 1500 mg of Depakote ER to see if my insomnia improves also.",7,7,1
"Depakote ER","LAGuy","August 14, 2017","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I started Depakote ER 2000mg at bedtime about a year ago after decades of ineffective treatment for depression and anxiety. Depakote proved that I was misdiagnosed: it quickly alleviated my psych. symptoms and allowed me to reduce Xanax XR dose by half and eliminate PRN Xanax. I haven't experienced the weight loss side effect, but did lose a lot of hair at first.  The hair seems to be thickening up now.  I would give it 10 stars except for the hair loss.",9,12,1
"Depakote ER","Huzaiff","September 5, 2016","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I was suffering from bipolar for 10 months.  After taking many medicines i was on divalproex 500 mg for 3 years and lamotrigine 150mg for 2 years.  I was able to handle stress and forget that i have any depression.  My dosage for both was kept to lowest 250 mg for divalproex and 50 mg for lamotrigine. But on this stage after having stress my symptoms reuccured but was not severe as before.  I will have too increase the dose again.",10,14,1

"Depakote ER","StayStrongJustBreath92","June 25, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","I started taking Divalproex(Depakote)250mg on June 10th and than on June 17th I was admitted into a psychiatric hospital because of my bipolar.  I learned from the psychiatrist there that the dosage I was on was absolutely nothing and would have no effect on me.  The psychiatrist ended up raising the dose to 750mg.  I definetly can tell that my mood is leveled out for the most part. I would recommended this to people with bipolar and people with seizures(I was diagnosed a few years ago with non eptiletic seizures).  So far I dont see any side effects, thank God.  I take this medication at night along with:  Aripiprazole(Abilify)15mg Trazodone(Desyrel)50mg Hydroxyzine(Vistaril)50mg Clonazepam(Klonopin)1mg",8,12,1
"Depakote ER","NunyaSAT","May 30, 2016","Taken for 10 years or more","I was treated for clinical depression from age 18-40 using a variety of medications. I've also struggled with alcoholism, drug and sex addiction most of my adult life. I had a period of six years' solid sobriety beginning in the mid 90's but, even sober, battled with diagnosed clinical depression. At that time I was being treated with Serzone. The more the doctor increased the dosage the more depressed I would become. I obsessed on failed relationships, acted out sexually and financially in very risky ways. I finally changed Psychiatrists at the suggestion of my Therapist. The new doctor analyzed my symptoms and indicated that I had been misdiagnosed with clinical depression. His prognosis was Bipolar II Disorder accompanied by acute depression",5,14,1

The only medication that clears up my head and makes me feel normal. Also it gets rid of my migranes. The only bad thing is a few side effects.  I gained weight and my hair fell out. And I was pretty lathargic at first. Takes a while but once it kicks in I felt like a whole person. I was off of it for a long time and recently was put back on it so going through side effects again but felt a difference rite away.",9,16,1
"Depakote ER","Susyg","April 27, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Honestly this medicine has saved my life! I went from having multiple long lasting episodes of mania to none. Ya i still get the thoughts but im relaxed and able to make conscious choices now that im on it. The only negative side affect is the hair loss but its temporary, but so worth it.

Would highly recommend.",9,22,1
"Depakote ER","HappytoB","January 13, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug took me out of a downward spiraling mixed episode, for that I'm thankful.  However, being BiPolar II, the initial dosage of 1750 mg. which was never recommended to lower after its effectiveness had been reached, almost put me right back to where I was.  I wouldn't recommend this drug if you're on the depressive side of BiPolar, or for any length of time/dosage that the medication isn't even recommended to be used for.  I've since switched to Lamictal, will see how it goes.",5,9,1

Give it a chance if U suffer from severe Bipolar, mood swings, anxiety/panic attacks, sleep disorder...etc. This is working. People close 2 me say I'm a lot calmer now. More rational.

After 3 weeks of Depakote my moods were pretty even and stable. I also felt a little numb, I missed my highs, but it was better than being psychotic one minute and crying in another. But at the 4 month mark my hair has started falling out in clumps, that was my only side effect. So I'm now transitioning to lithium. Fingers crossed.",9,27,2

It's been a awhile since I've tried Depakote, but it's the first thing they put me on in the hospital.  It's been 15 days I think it's ok, but when I lay down I feel like weights are holding me to the bed and I seem to get disorientated as to my location in the house ( weird right??).

I can't take the generic. It really bothers my stomach. It doesn't do much for depression. Anything I take for depression makes me manic. I have been on almost medications on the market. I have to learn to live with depression and work my hardest to accept it. I've been living with bi-polar for 38 years. I wish that the brand name wasn't so expensive.

I notice weight gain (though could be due to less nightly manic behavior and age), some upset stomach at times, overall, I think it stabilizes me.   Caffeine does make me feel more alive when on ER.  Otherwise feel quite lethargic, apathetic, less motivated.  I tend to feel more like I am depressed when taking this medicine. Will look into combination of Anti-depressive.",6,38,2

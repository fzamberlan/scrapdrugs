"Venlafaxine","Ovey50","March 25, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Been on this medication venlafaxine for 2 years now along with  quetiapine for bi polar and the antidepressant works.

"Venlafaxine","sampsy345","March 20, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I'm a 21 year old female and I've been suffering an undiagnosed bipolar spectrum disorder for several years. I finally got diagnosed about 6 months ago and I started 200 mg Lamictal which changed my life almost instantly. However, my depressive episodes were still fairly debilitating, although less intense than before. I started 150 mg Venlafaxine in addition to the Lamictal and it took about 7 weeks to fully kick in, and so began the happiest time of my life. These drugs saved my life and the Venlafaxine, especially, made me happy again. The only side effects I had were decreased appetite and lowered sex drive. I didn't mind the decreased appetite, but the low sex drive sucked. I recently doubled my dose to 300 mg b/c some life stuff happened that was bringing out my depression. It's been 1 week and it’s made my sex drive fly through the roof. I really hope this isn't a temporary side effect because it feels amazing after years of not having a sex drive from the depressive episodes",10,3,1

I did try to ween myself off to 75 mgs because I hate having to take meds daily. But with major depression I have had to go back up to the 150 daily. I have not become any better. I have become worse. I cry daily. I think about suicide numerous times a day. All of the above comments are 100% correct. The withdrawals are horrifying!",3,3,1

"Venlafaxine","carinab","August 10, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've been on venlafaxine 300mg a day.  I take this with alongside Quetiapine 100mg, a day. I've been on these 2 drugs, for a few years now after being sectioned twice. Without it I would not function. I was on several drugs before venlafaxine, eg trazadone etc but they didn't work hence being sectioned. Since being on this drug for a few years now am stable and have not had a hospital admission for my mental health which is a relief to my family. They are no longer out looking for me on bridges or train tracks etc. I could not function without this combination of tablets and go out shopping with my family and take my dogs out. So I think this is a great drug",8,8,1

"Venlafaxine","NikNak","December 16, 2018","-","I was prescribed 150 mg a day. But I decided to start myself at 75mg. The first day my anxiety was super bad, I was shaking, didn’t eat, had to leave my classes because I was so irritable and couldn’t sit still. I got home and my pupils were HUGE. The second day I had a migraine, dilated pupils, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, no appetite, random muscle spasms, lost feeling in my legs randomly, bad anxiety, chest pains. My migraine got worse throughout the day and while on this you can’t take many pain relievers, so I tried to sleep it off. After an hour I woke up. I knew something felt wrong. I had felt out of body for the 2 days I was on it but I had my friend rush me to the hospital and I passed out multiple times, threw up, still had all the same symptoms as previously listed. I was super dehydrated. The doctors hooked me up to an IV for a few hours to get rid of my symptoms. Not saying you shouldn’t try it but I would recommend trying something else before this.",1,2,1

It has helped me wonderfully with my depression but the side long term effects make me hate it. I have become dependent on it. I believe It has ruined my short term memory. If I miss one dose, immediately after the next dose I get sick. I’m nauseous for the day, I have a migraine and the worst is the muscle and bone aches. My body hurts so bad. If I miss two doses, I become psychotic. I can’t speak normally. I repeat the same thing over and over. I shake terribly. I feel trapped in my head. I hallucinate. I get brain zaps too.  I’m terrified to come off of this drug in search of an alternative but I am at the highest dose and it’s not working anymore.  I am incredibly stable mentally. I’m a busy mother of 4 and I take the mental health in my life very seriously. I don’t recommend this drug unless it is for short term use.",5,13,1

"Venlafaxine","TheNoob","June 7, 2017","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This drug was the worst experience of my life watching my partner take it! He was prescribed it by his GP for cycling moods (later diagnosed with BPL and Rapid cycling Bi Polar). After a week he begun to run away from home, sat in the road in the rain,  ran away from work. (before he had held a job for 9 years despite awful mood swings). GP felt this was 'normal' and upped his dose. He then begun to plan his own suicide and was only stopped thanks to a security guard at the car park. He stopped caring about me or anyone else. He then two days later turned psychotic with a knife (we are taking about a gentle animal loving world peace advocate I might add). Stayed in a mental hospital to detox, now on quetrapine, much better. Awful drug!",1,14,1
"Venlafaxine","chgoman","May 28, 2017","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Venlafaxine is a good drug.  It helps with depression and anxiety.  What it doesn't work so well with is the mania.  If anything, it can make the mania worse.  I find adjusting my dose works the best.  So anywhere from 150mg to 200mg.  I know that is not the wisest course, but it does help keep the mania from being too strong.  Olanzapine also helps me.",8,9,1

I know Venlafaxine is contraindicated in people who experience mania and I have had some issues with that but overall, with other medications that stabilise my mood, I have found Venlafaxine to be a life saver. I am 23, been hospitalised before for a long time and it was the first med I agreed to go back on after a period of desperation following a year of refusal to take meds due to extreme anti-psychiatry views. Now my anxiety is massively decreased, I feel much more on a level, less irritable, far less lethargic. This medication has done so much for me. No side effects apart from the initial week or two of starting it I got some insomnia and occasionally I get a very dry mouth. Sometimes a bad tremor.",10,26,1

Several years later after years of both manic and depressive episodes,  the worst  full-blown manic episode got me re-diagnosed as bi-polar. I was prescribed venlafaxine, a very small dose which made me violently ill for over 2 weeks, but after that, it improved and I felt better. My dosage has been upped numerous times. I am now at 225 mg and have been for a couple of years. It has been a life saver. I feel like I have a new life; one without rages, anxiety, and depression.

"Venlafaxine","Blckft","November 26, 2015","Taken for 1 to 6 months","This medicine was a God send for the depression. Shortly after beginning it I developed sores on my tongue.The next week my face began hurting and swelling, first at the jaw hinges, then up to my temples. The pain got so bad I couldn't open my mouth to eat. I realized I was grinding my teeth, clenching my jaws and flexing my facial muscles. Long story short, I am off the meds and on a different antidepressant. The 2 weeks of being off my meds nearly killed me (suicidal alcoholic). I now know that other medical issues combined with the drug to cause the extreme reaction. Please be careful with this medicine.

When it was still able to effect me, it was super useful. The bad part is that you'll suffer from withdrawal symptoms if you don't take it for over 24 hours. I ran out in college for FIVE DAYS (I lived in one city and my psychiatrist was in another) and I was miserable - chills, weird dreams, everything. Never let it run out and never forget to take it. Otherwise it's a good medicine.",8,19,2

Only the Mirtazapine worked for my mood but I had horrific side effects with it so doctor suggested Venlafaxine. I started on 37.5mg twice a day and got quite bad nausea for about a week. After that had gone it was great. My mood dropped a bit from being happy on Mirtazapine to being on such a low dose of Venlafaxine but now I'm on 150mg a day it seems to be improving again. I'm very careful not to miss a dose though from what I've read about the withdrawal symptoms.

But, without a mood stabilizer, I soon went into a hypomanic stage. At times, on the medicine, I went into an full-blown manic phases. Once again, without a mood stabilizer. The most challenging part about this medicine, (or the generic venlafaxine which I took) is quitting it. Now, I am a poster child for doing it wrong, no doubt. That is, it is extremely challenging to quit this medicine going Cold Turkey. You will read online where people will tell you point blank, Do not quit this medicine cold turkey. Listen to them.

"Venlafaxine","Anonymous","April 20, 2009","-","<b>Effexor (venlafaxine):</b>			 Just came from the doctor after weening myself to 75 mg of Effexor. Bad move, doctor put me back to 150mg. Doctor put me on Buspar with my Effexor. FANTASTIC. Haven't felt this good in years, but I felt so good I thought I could get off the Effexor. Lesson here, if you feel better, don't stop taking your medicines, it's working. Ask your doctor about taking Buspar with the Effexor. I have never felt better. No more racing thoughts, etc. Now, just waiting for Effexor to work it's way back into my system. As for coupling it with the Buspar - RIGHT ON THE MONEY.",0,35,3

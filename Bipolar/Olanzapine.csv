"Olanzapine","bipolar one forever","June 1, 2020","-","<b>Zyprexa (olanzapine):</b>			 I just started Zyprexa from a new doc, it is for my bipolar one. Been doing ok mostly for over 10 years. I take 1200 of lithium daily. Trazodone 300mg for sleep . Last year trazodone stopped working last fall several occasions of auditory hallucinations barely sleep 2hrs nightly tried all kinds of meds from one doc he gave up.  Referred to new doc by pcp recently just started zyprexa up to 10mg. Sleeping about 5 or so hours at night so far no side effects but it is early days. Lithium made me fat and killed my thyroid which made me fat so no worries I just need sleep and calm my mind",0,4,1

"Olanzapine","Poppy","May 22, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I’ve been on olanzapine 2.5 mg for 8 years and it has been a fantastic medication for me. I suffer from anxiety and severe insomnia, and Olanzapine has worked perfectly well. My anxiety is non existent now, and best of all I am sleeping really well. I haven’t gained much weight (only 5 kg) . I tried to come off it a few times and I found it very difficult, mostly because the insomnia was so bad, and the anxiety came back with a vengeance. So for now I’m happy on a small dose. I might take it for the rest of my life if I can stay well with this medication.",10,3,1
"Olanzapine","Orfeus","May 1, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I'm bipolar type 1 and was recently admitted to the hospital for a manic episode when I got there I was on several medications for my symptoms. When I got to the hospital they gave me olanzapine kept me on Dexedrine took me off the others. I’m very pleased with the olanzapine : no paranoid thoughts I feel very calm and content. While I did gain 20lbs so far I also feel somehow more positive about myself regardless of weight gain.  The only real problem so far is I feel a bit sedated and tired and it is making it difficult to stay awake and do things all day without going to sleep. For a bit doctor told me to take it at night instead and my body should get used to it after a while anyway and the sedative effect will be less of an issue. Overall total game changer for my mental health and quality of life would recommend to any one who has issues with mania, paranoia, anxiety and/or negative thoughts as it makes me feel generally calm and positive :)",9,6,1
"Olanzapine","Bipolar Chick","May 1, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I’m bipolar 1 and have been through a bunch of different meds. Zyprexa was the first med I tried to get me down from a manic episode which worked but I went off of it because it was way too sedating. I was on 10 mg then 5 mg.  When I went off of it I had a lot of anxiety from withdrawal. I then tried Rexulti which messed up my sleep and gave me anxiety and even when I went off of it I was still waking up everyday at 4 am and had awful anxiety. Then tried seroquel and vraylar (bad restlessness) Finally decided to try zyprexa again but this time at 2.5 mg (subtherepeutic dose) and although I’m groggy in the morning I overall am really happy with my choice. I fall asleep at 12 and sleep like a baby till 9 and don’t have the awful anxiety in my chest anymore. I would say zyprexa can be a great drug at a very low dose. I’m def more chilled out but I prefer that to being anxious and unable to sleep.",8,2,1
"Olanzapine","yurioc","April 30, 2020","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I first started Olanzapine during a psychotic episode caused by mania. It does have some benefits: I was much calmer, slept amazingly well, my mind was as peaceful as a lake and the meditation induced telepathy stopped completely. However, the downsides were too much for me: it did nothing for my depression, I was feeling down all the time, no motivation for doing anything, no creativity and could easily sleep most of the day, which we can hardly call it  living . I also gained 4kg, which is nothing compared to a good part of people here. For a period, I used it with Lexapro, which did nothing for my depression as well. Another huge thing you all must be aware is how difficult it is to withdraw from it. That was easily the worst week of my life. Now I’m switching to Abilify.",5,0,1

His Pychiatrist prescribed an extremely expensive drug, Zyprexa, then insisted he remain on it for 6 months then left the country.  My husband ran track in our house, wore his ski parka even tho 85 degrees, took several family members to help calm him, on and on. He was uncontrollably crazed, When he developed smacking lips about 4 months in, usually permanent, we stopped Zyprexa triggering DT's. His Primary care doc stepped in and tried various meds adding up to 4 that completely incapacitated him. More crazy man, upchucking, couldn't get out of bed when beloved company visited.  We traveled to Portland, Or., finding a good Psychiatrist who understood meds, put him on 4 other meds to calm him, then began slowly toggling him off the mess. It took nearly 2 years to detox him. Worse yet, he was never the same again.  If you value your health, and the health of those who love you, then grab your hat and RUN FROM ZYPREXA!",0,9,1

Sadly, I have had to get off this medication because it caused me to gain 20 lbs within a few short months, and also made my thinking slow down. However, this without a doubt was one of the best medications I have tried. I was able to finally get some rest and didn't constantly wake up throughout the night. My depressive thoughts decreased, though they were still there sometimes, they were manageable. I was able to go days without feeling completely poorly. My racing thoughts decreased, and I felt like I could think without having racing thoughts, or having 100 ideas going on in my head at once. My irritation levels almost ceased to exist. I was pleasantly surprised to see after trying several medications, that this is one of the only medications that has worked on me. If you can get around the weight gain, this is definitely a medication that is a must-try. Maybe I will try this medication again in the future if all else fails.",0,24,1

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD last year. Took Abilify and became irritated easily, lamictal and kept forgetting things, then I started 30 mg of Prozac and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa combo. It instantly got me out of depression/ mood swings and helped me get back to school &amp; focus a little bit more. I will say that I feel a little dull/ do not want to talk much &amp; gained 25 pounds in one month being on it. No matter how much I workout, I do not lose the weight. I honestly love the pros of this drug, I can smile and laugh again. But I do not want it to effect my confidence and self esteem because I am gaining so much weight. I am now weaning off zyprexa and trying latuda. My advice to anyone trying Zyprexa- give this a try and expect the weight gain to occur, it will help reduce negative thoughts, excessive worrying &amp; mood swings. Have faith, and try it, I really believe Zyprexa will help get someone out of their worst days.",0,26,1

I even took it once after coming home from class in the middle of the day and it caused me to sleep 17 hours straight + gave me sleep paralysis.

I then take 5g morning and night for 3 days and the episode is quickly over. It slows my brain down and combined with reducing activity I return to normal. This means I do not routinely take it, I do not suffer the side effects and I am able to control my mania easily. I think other people  could do the same and avoid becoming zombies and gaining weight. In the last few years I have begun having bouts of depression. These I am still trying to control, and as yet have just waited them out. After 4 to 5 weeks the depression generally lifts on its own.

Prior to using this I had a severe manic episode induced by Zoloft. It worked almost immediately for getting rid of my psychosis and helping me sleep.

I gained about 25 pounds in a matter of 7 days.  Weight has levelled off and I've been on 2.5mg for most of the time I've taken this. The longer you take it the higher your chances of developing tardive dyskinesia, so keep that in mind. Over the past few months my side effects have worsened tremendously.

"Zyprexa","bipolar one forever","June 1, 2020","-","I just started Zyprexa from a new doc, it is for my bipolar one. Been doing ok mostly for over 10 years. I take 1200 of lithium daily. Trazodone 300mg for sleep . Last year trazodone stopped working last fall several occasions of auditory hallucinations barely sleep 2hrs nightly tried all kinds of meds from one doc he gave up.  Referred to new doc by pcp recently just started zyprexa up to 10mg. Sleeping about 5 or so hours at night so far no side effects but it is early days. Lithium made me fat and killed my thyroid which made me fat so no worries I just need sleep and calm my mind",9,4,1
"Zyprexa","j. Daniels","April 7, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Zypresa made my husband a crazy man. He had minor Bipolar. His Pychiatrist prescribed an extremely expensive drug, Zyprexa, then insisted he remain on it for 6 months then left the country.  My husband ran track in our house, wore his ski parka even tho 85 degrees, took several family members to help calm him, on and on. He was uncontrollably crazed, When he developed smacking lips about 4 months in, usually permanent, we stopped Zyprexa triggering DT's. His Primary care doc stepped in and tried various meds adding up to 4 that completely incapacitated him. More crazy man, upchucking, couldn't get out of bed when beloved company visited.  We traveled to Portland, Or., finding a good Psychiatrist who understood meds, put him on 4 other meds to calm him, then began slowly toggling him off the mess. It took nearly 2 years to detox him. Worse yet, he was never the same again.  If you value your health, and the health of those who love you, then grab your hat and RUN FROM ZYPREXA!",1,9,1
"Zyprexa","sj1428","December 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I had a horrible, 6-day experience with this medication Zyprexa. While it was prescribed to me primarily for sleep, which 5 mg was effective, it made my anxiety 10x worse with paranoia and tremors. It was the worst. It has been three nights without it now and I still feel it's effects of increased anxiety and a fog-like head. The physical symptoms ceased 48 hours post-Zyprexa. I took 20 mg of Paxil with this medication for anxiety and was noticing some improvement with Paxil alone. Zyprexa made me feel as if I was never taking Paxil AND take five steps backwards. My official diagnosis is TBD but this was the first medication I've taken where I absolutely refuse to take again at any dosage",1,6,1
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","December 5, 2019","-","I have bipolar II and have tried multiple medications. Sadly, I have had to get off this medication because it caused me to gain 20 lbs within a few short months, and also made my thinking slow down. However, this without a doubt was one of the best medications I have tried. I was able to finally get some rest and didn't constantly wake up throughout the night. My depressive thoughts decreased, though they were still there sometimes, they were manageable. I was able to go days without feeling completely poorly. My racing thoughts decreased, and I felt like I could think without having racing thoughts, or having 100 ideas going on in my head at once. My irritation levels almost ceased to exist. I was pleasantly surprised to see after trying several medications, that this is one of the only medications that has worked on me. If you can get around the weight gain, this is definitely a medication that is a must-try. Maybe I will try this medication again in the future if all else fails.",8,24,1
"Zyprexa","CT","November 11, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Hello. I am currently taking Zyprexa 2.5 mg for approximately 10 months in conjunction with Lexapro 30 mg and bupropion XL 300mg for OCD, bipolar,  anxiety and depression.  The meds helped to a point and now I feel like I am not progressing in my therapy. I have just been increased to 5mg of zyprexa,  so we shall see. My big concern is the weight gain. I've gained 30 pounds in a year and a half. I hope the weight gain isn't dose related.  To be continued....",6,14,1
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","October 22, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Zyprexa was a life saver for me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and OCD last year. Took Abilify and became irritated easily, lamictal and kept forgetting things, then I started 30 mg of Prozac and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa combo. It instantly got me out of depression/ mood swings and helped me get back to school &amp; focus a little bit more. I will say that I feel a little dull/ do not want to talk much &amp; gained 25 pounds in one month being on it. No matter how much I workout, I do not lose the weight. I honestly love the pros of this drug, I can smile and laugh again. But I do not want it to effect my confidence and self esteem because I am gaining so much weight. I am now weaning off zyprexa and trying latuda. My advice to anyone trying Zyprexa- give this a try and expect the weight gain to occur, it will help reduce negative thoughts, excessive worrying &amp; mood swings. Have faith, and try it, I really believe Zyprexa will help get someone out of their worst days.",9,26,1
"Zyprexa","Itel","October 16, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Stay away from Zyprexa.

"Zyprexa","Spin","October 14, 2019","-","Diagnosis: Severe rapid cycling bipolar, heavy on mania Zoloft is a very positive experience Benefits: - No extreme highs, only small and easily controlled bouts of hypomania  - No staying up for days on end anymore, more restful sleep in general  -Increased appetite and slight weight gain, may be a con for some but I have no to low appetite and am clinically underweight. 3lb total gain over 3 months -Less irritability, lesws suicidal ideation, less call of the void  - No real low swings at all, either neutral or normal emotional response -Decreased anxiety -I still have emotions and interests unlike when on Lithium/Zoloft/Lexapro, on those I would sit and just stare at my wall uncaring for 15+ hours a day and still had periods of mania intermixed. Cons: -Slight decrease in motivation/interest in hobbies like video games but not severe -Makes my RLS flare up especially with any amount of alcohol in the mix. Easily combat this by waiting until I'm on the verge of sleep to take it",10,7,1
"Zyprexa","Teresa","October 11, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Started zyprexa 7 years ago. I had never been happier. I laughed, enjoyed life, lost the paranoia - then my yearly physicals started showing my A1C was elevated so I started on metformin. I gained between 6-12 lbs/year(132-179). Now on a BP med. Suffer dry mouth &amp; tongue edema. I take 25mg benadryl  every 4-6 hrs to prevent it. I've weaned down to 1/2 of 1.25mg every 3rd night. I'm ok as long as I don't go past that 3rd night. If I try for 4 I pay dearly. It's like I've been hit by a Mack truck-the worst case of flu ever. I take the missed dose &amp; 24-36 hrs later I feel human again. This drug saved my life because I was suicidal but  also now I don't want to die of complications from the co-morbidities that I'm developing now because I can't get off it. The real kicker: zyprexa affects your metabolism so it's even harder to lose weight &amp; if interferes with how metformin works making it less effective. Talk about a double edged sword. I may be on this for the rest of my life.",8,8,1
"Zyprexa","Rizzo","September 29, 2019","-","Zyprexa is  best mood stabilizer I’ve been on. It is so calming. It decreases agitation, the racing thoughts, helps you sleep. Does not make me groggy- I take 7.5 mg at night. The only reason it’s not a 10 is I’ve gained some weight so I’m taking some topamax for it. Love zyprexa.",9,12,1
"Zyprexa","Shark","August 6, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This medication, Zyprexa has helped me out a lot for my bipolar. The biggest downside is being tired a lot but sleep is very important. Once I take it I can’t do anything at all and force myself to stay in bed. I can sleep for a long time and feel very groggy in the morning. I did not gain any weight whatsoever on Zyprexa. I suggest that people listen to their doctor and give it a try. I’ve been on it for a little over 2 years and staying on 2.5MG for  maintenance . I am in remission now. Unfortunately, it doesn’t do much for anxiety so you will absolutely have to continue seeking treatment for that if you have any anxiety issues.",8,9,1
"Zyprexa","momo","June 17, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Zyprexa makes you gain weight so fast.  I  used to be anorexic and watched out with what I ate so I stayed in shape. But this medicine makes you crave sugar and makes you feel hungry 24/7, also you are really really tired. It only helps with psychotic behavior if your dose is pretty high so you can't feel anything and because you want to sleep all day.",1,22,1

We go to the Drs and this is what she prescribed him at a dose of 3mg. It worked as to stopping his manic episodes. BUT he legit is a Zombie now. He sleeps all the time. Is always tired. Emotionless. Unsure of himself. Doesn’t talk. Doesn’t eat. Doesn’t laugh. He basically is nothing. It’s really sad to watch, and I’m actually hoping his Dr will change his meds this week because this is NO way to live.",3,33,1
"Zyprexa","Sofia","April 23, 2019","-","I've put on 19kgs taking Zyprexa It's helped a little with my mood disorder and outbursts however my weight problem is out of control, hence this has caused me more stress seeing myself go from 60kgs to 79kgs in 6 months.",5,9,1
"Zyprexa","Salsa","December 9, 2018","-","I have been on olanzapine for 5 yrs.   Keeps my mood stable, no irritability, no heavy sinking terrible depression. I went off it for only four months without doctor's permission and I went manic, talking too much, lots of energy extremely painful headaches and delusions of people trying to check me out, little nagging voices, that scared me, annoyed me. Psychosis. All the other bipolar people I met at the psych hospital didn't have psychosis. I only shared the psychosis experience with one man with schizophrenia. Mind you this medicine, for me at 10 mg, really works effectively for my severe case of mania, depression, and psychosis, all in one full swoop. Once I'm stable, I can function just like any other person, just carrying a heavy body around from when my body metabolism acts up on the medicine from age 16-19. Now age 21 weight is pretty stable. This medicine DOES work. But you should only use it if it's for a case like mine.",0,25,1
"Zyprexa","Jo","November 16, 2018","-","Zyprexa was my only miracle med but health wise it ruined me. I was on it for 10 years. All my long term health risk that occurred was from this medication. In 10 years I went from 112 to 296 pounds. I got low thyroid issues now on medication for life for that. Developed high cholesterol, vertigo I developed. These are the long term use of zyprexa and I got them. Yes it helps wonders but why risk your health. Binge eating can occur I developed that real bad also at the 7 year mark. Took it at night and hour later needed to eat nonstop. When they talk about higher side effects it can happen and does. Started with the less and got the severe and now it's a journey also itself for my health. I would stay cautious of this medication. For sure it does cause extreme weight gain which cause all other high risk health issues.",5,19,1
"Zyprexa","OpposumMajor","November 1, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Only been on Zyprexa for 5 days, but I'm loving it so far. I was hospitalized five days ago for extreme mania, they took me off of Abilify (which I believe caused the mania, I'd only been put on it two weeks before). They added Zyprexa 10mg to my trazodone at night (also take Lamictal and Zoloft in the am). It was a bit too sedating at 10mg, so they bumped it down to 5mg and it's perfect. I've always had mad munchies at night from the trazodone anyways, and am still not hungry till dinner anyways, so it isn't really causing me any weight gain. It brought me out of mania the first time I took it, I hope to never be without this med again, as of now. Again, just started it 5 days ago but I've actually lost 4 pounds since then, and I can't say enough good about it!",10,14,1

"Zyprexa","Jason","June 27, 2018","Taken for 5 to 10 years","DO NOT take this medication unless you are either psychotic, bipolar or have an extreme neurological condition. I took this medication for 8 years and it ruined my life to be honest. These drugs are EXTREMELY dangerous and powerful and can ruin your life even by taking it for 1 week. This drug is NOT for anxiety or ANY mild to average condition. Move to the countryside for 3 months and rent a cabin, it will solve your issues. If you are a parent, do not EVER put any child on this drug. Anti-psych drugs are 1000 times more dangerous than you can ever imagine. Same goes for Abilify or any atypical or typical anti-psychotic. Tardive dyskinesia is a potentially permanent side effect that can ruin your life within a week. Saying that, they work EXTREMELY effectively for severe mental disorders and may save your life if you are suicidal.",5,16,1

Had been suffering of depression and hypomanic episodes but after taking only 5mg of Olanzapine I feel completely different - no more mood swings at all. I feel like a normal person. This medication saved and even improved the quality of the life I'm living at the moment. Beside Olanzapine I got prescribed antidepressant Escitaloprame which also works great in treating Bipolar disorder.",10,13,1
"Zyprexa","Dimitri","May 5, 2018","-","Out of the 4 anti psychotics I tried this one worked wonders for me. I was diagnosed back in 2011 for a psychotic episode and developed bi polar psychosis. Took 5mgs for years and I was feeling great. The only thing is that I would have some tactile hallucinations but wouldn’t hear any voices. I would just feel like a crazy maniac that wouldn’t sleep for days before going on zyprexa. Anyways I went off of it and then a year later I am here taking it again because I just can’t stand my anxiety and delusions and mood swings. I mix it with seroquel sometimes. Anyways this drug works wonders. I don’t get an increased appetite. The only problem is that when I wake up I don’t feel like eating anything so I end up eating at 2pm. The side effects for me are decreased appetite and some fatigue but other than that, I can finally enjoy life again. Remember that it takes a few weeks for it to take full effects and side effects do become more tolerable through time.",9,18,1

"Zyprexa","Beth","April 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","My psychiatrist put me on 10 mg of Zyprexa and 20 mg of Prozac. He said those two meds are supposed to work well together. After two months I was still feeling depressed so he increased the Zyprexa to 15 mg. This has been a miracle drug for me. I fall asleep within 30 min of taking it and sleep very well except it is difficult to wake up in the morning. I set three alarms around my bedroom. One I have to physically get out of bed to turn off so it helps me get up. But that side effect is getting better after two months of taking Zyprexa. I no longer have ruminating thoughts or bouts of rage. My mood is very even. I have had some weight gain due to the med making me feel hungry all the time. Now I'm trying to drink water instead of eating and that seems to help.",9,13,2
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","March 26, 2018","-","I have a love hate relationship with Zyprexa.  I was initially put on it when I had a breakdown, it was the worst I ever felt mentally in my life.  Before going on it I hadn’t slept soundly for 10 years.  Taking Zyprexa was a last resort drug, and it worked great for getting me through that tough time.  When I started to take it, I could finally get a good nights sleep, I can’t even explain how good that felt after going so long with out it.  I also feel like it saved my marriage.  Now the downsides:  I gained about 40 lbs since I’ve started taking it 12 years ago.  It makes me feel hungry constantly and crave sweets.  Another thing is I am so unmotivated, it’s so frustrating!  Anytime I try to reduce it I find I get irritable and not able to sleep, so then I go back up again.  I definitely think this drug is not good for everyone, I would only recommend it as a last resort.",6,12,2

It worked great at first, but now it works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I take it because I have bipolar 2 disorder. I need it to calm down my mind when I go to sleep. I want to know if there is anything else I can take, or does Zyprexa come in a stronger dose than 20 mg ?",5,7,2
"Zyprexa","HonkingAntelope","February 13, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","Been on 20mg a day for a couple years.  Been off of everything for about eight months.  When I was taking it, I had zero issues with weight gain.  Another huge benefit was that it reliably put me to sleep.  Take my 20mg football in the evening and it’s lights out within two hours.  But getting up in the morning was tough.  Plus it did slow me down mentally.  I didn’t think it did, but I had a few old friends point out that I’m way slower than I used to be.  Like most psych meds, it can work wonders for one patient and do more harm than good for another.  Due to life’s circumstances, I had to quit cold turkey.  Bad idea.  Sleepless nights and all that... Thankfully, my condition is on a very mild end of the spectrum.  You absolutely have to work with your doctor to find out what works best for YOU!  All the best!",10,12,2

"Zyprexa","edyth55","June 30, 2010","-","I was diagnosed as Bipolar disorder at the age of 49.  I was immediately put on Zyprexa and essentially, the next four years are a blur to me.  To say I felt like a zombie is a gross understatement. I changed my Doctor and insisted he take me off the drug which he did.  I am now taking 'plain old lithium' and have been doing well for the past five years.  I understand that everyone doesn't have the same experience with Zyprexa that I had, but people should be aware that there are long-proven alternatives.  I only wish that my Doctor had considered them first.",1,28,5
"Zyprexa","Glue","June 10, 2010","-","I have been taking Zyprexa for about 5 years. Started at 5 mg and am now at 2.5 or 1.25, depending on the day. This is for bipolar. I've tried to go off it (because I felt dulled and had a preoccupation with food) a few different times and had severe depression/anxiety symptoms recur. I also take Prozac (20mg) and Lamictal (100 mg). I don't think the Lamictal does anything but the Zyprexa seems to be the glue that keeps me together. Weight gain was an issue but have recently lost 20 lbs through diet and exercise (and reducing dose). I would rather not have to take it but it so greatly improves my quality of life that I feel I should stay on it.",8,48,5
"Zyprexa","Dim","April 29, 2010","-","Great medication but put on 10kg in one month.  You have to seriously discipline yourself otherwise you will almost certainly put on weight.",8,26,5
"Zyprexa","pretty-good","March 7, 2010","-","I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 15 years and for the first time experienced a mania state beyond anything I imagined or experienced before.  I was suffering from severe paranoia and psychosomatic symptoms.  Zyprexa is a God-send and I am happy with it.  My major problem with it is the morning hangovers I feel. I have gained weight, but desperately needed to do so.",8,34,5
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","January 12, 2010","-","I was on 2.5 mg and it made me into a hungry zombie. All my emotions were flat, it made life completely unpleasant, everyday was a struggle to get through, and sex was completely numb.  However, it was a very effective  medication for bipolar one disorder, if it wasn't for the side effects I'd still be on it.",6,45,5
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","December 9, 2009","-","I've been taking Zypexa for almost 3 years now.  It has been wonderful for me and my family. I had tried so many different medicines that I had given up. I now hardly have any mood swings and I can sleep at night.  The down side is that I have gained a lot of weight, but to make me easy to live with for my family it's worth it!",10,45,5

"Zyprexa","Pillboxfox","September 19, 2009","-","At 5mg/day zyprexa makes a real difference for me.  Combined witht the right antidepressant it takes care of my depressive episodes which can by the way be very severe.  The side effects I have is increased sleep and increased appetite.  Haven't gained any weight on it.",0,55,5
"Zyprexa","seanc25","August 30, 2009","-","I've been taking this for about week and I already feel the side effects. I can't make any major choices because I'm so far from the 4 week point but I wont give it a bad name because we suffer from depression and bi-polar and if we expect the worst we will get the worst.",7,16,5

"Zyprexa","Anonymous","July 16, 2009","-","I was confirmed with Bipolar disorder in late 2008. My father is a severe case of bi-polar and is medication resistant to the point where E.C.T doesn't do anything. So my doctors (considering my family history) put me on Zyprexa. I had no benefits, only side effects, the worst being recurring hallucinations. I didn't gain weight (it would be good for me, I weigh about a 100 lbs). It's not the miracle drug for me.",6,28,5
"Zyprexa","Anonymous","July 14, 2009","-","At first I was reluctant on taking this medication, but eventually I realized that I needed it.

Its a blessing for my husband and kids that we have found something that works. I am happy on Zyprexa so far.",0,84,6

"Zyprexa","Anonymous","March 23, 2009","-","I've taken Zyprexa as an adjunct to Lithium for Bipolar I. My thoughts are slower and it has gotten rid of any anxiety (this I think is the best side effect). I have not had issues with weight gain. I change between 5 and 10 mg per day and how I feel. Sometimes it can cause me to sleep late and need to take it earlier in the evening to avoid that.  Great medicine to keep me stable and stop intrusive thinking.",9,93,6

I am now border line diabetic, and my cholesterol level very high. I am now not on Zyprexa. The medicine did the job it is supposed to but my doctor and I are looking for a medication similar to Zyprexa with out the weight gain.",8,109,6

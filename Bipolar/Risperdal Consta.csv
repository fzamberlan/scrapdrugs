"Risperdal Consta",".","January 31, 2020","-","Causes dizziness, makes me light headed, unable to think, gives me feeling of discouragement. Literally the worst drug ever.",1,6,1
"Risperdal Consta","vandalized corpse","September 16, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Again a terrible tragedy that I was subjected to this drug against my will because of a temporary behavioral anomaly. After a month of taking became very hallow and unbelievably slow, especially at tasks such as reading, thinking, and communicating. Periodically had some sort of dyskinesia and felt like all the memory was being sucked out of me and I would have to get stuck in a weird transition state . It was a very frightening and terrible experience, as if I could not take care of myself. The only way to get rid of that catatonia was to take sedatives and sleep it off. I am not sure how to label this symptom, but I will guess the most appropriate labelling would be either catatonia or severe delirium with dyskinesia. The symptom disappeared after 6 months of not taking this medicine.",1,9,1
"Risperdal Consta","PostmodenistCupie","August 19, 2016","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Worst experience on this drug!! Developed sciatica, gained fifty pounds on it and had my first gallstones flare up on it. Was on it for about six months. Beware!! Make sure whomever injects knows how to do it. Was in pain from the sciatica for about a year after discontinuing the drug.",1,8,1

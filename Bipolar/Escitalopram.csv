"Escitalopram","Rosie","April 5, 2020","Taken for less than 1 month","I have cyclothymia and I’m under 18. I was also in a depressive episode at the time. I’ve tried other ssris and all they did was make me depressed. My doctor put me on lexapro because I have really bad anxiety. It caused me to be in a very dark placel, very depressed, emotionally numb, and felt almost robotic like. I was also on seroquel and lamictal. I think ssris just make me more suicidal for some reason.",1,4,1
"Escitalopram","potato","February 4, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Hello, I've been long diagnosed bipolar II (since a preteen) I've tried many medications with awful outcomes - escitalopram has been the only thing that has ever helped. I started out on 10 mg which was eventually increased to 20 mg which I continue to take to this day. My disaster plan with my doctor is to start quetiapine once daily along with my escitalopram which has worked great. This plan has kept me out of the hospital and psych ward. My only complaint about escitalopram is the sexual dysfunction side effect. I am lucky that I am still able to achieve orgasm but it takes 4x as long as I do unmedicated. I know this is such an awful side effect but you have to look at the pros and cons... don't give up on your medication for a partner.",10,4,1
"Escitalopram","Morticia","January 27, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I've been of escitalopram for a month now, and I can't explain I just feel so... ok. I'm bipolar type II and before starting therapy and the meds I used to deeply love or hate myself. I used to think I was amazing, beautiful, great at everything, and then the hypomania would pass, enters the depression and hating myself for being rude to others, arrogant, talking too much, believing that was me. Anyway, the drug made me nauseous and sleepy for the first week, but after that I'm really happy with it. I'm more calm, I'm stable and feel in control of my life and emotions for the first time ever. The only negative point in my experience is that it makes me drunk way faster, but since I only drink occasionally and with friends it isn't a huge problem.",10,3,1

"Escitalopram","dreamer428","September 19, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","This (escitalopram) is the third drug I tried for anxiety and depression before I was diagnosed with bipolar ii. I feel like myself. I no longer overthink minor setbacks or inconveniences and have an easier time managing stress. I’ve been taking Lexapro for two years. Tried other mood stabilizers in conjunction but stopped as they didn’t help. Side effects: I get very tired early evening always and experienced nausea first few months.",9,10,1
"Escitalopram","thankful","July 27, 2019","-","After battling anxiety and depression since childhood (recently diagnosed as bipolar ii), and trying COUNTLESS drugs as therapy, lexapro is the first to have such a profound effect on me. I feel like myself, and not just every now and then, but everyday. Things that would have thrown me for a loop of overthinking in the past no longer do, I can rationalize and talk myself out of negative thinking, and I'm not constantly spiraling. I feel like I have my life back thanks to this miracle of a medicine. I recently applied and got accepted for my dream job, am moving to my dream city, and am handling it like I've wanted to but never could. Finding the right medication is a JOURNEY and can be such a frustration, but stick with it because when you do, it helps so much.  ALSO, my only downside thus far (have been taking for 3 weeks now) is that I am VERY sleepy.",9,12,1

"Escitalopram","Ogre","October 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I don't rapid cycle,  really.   I have been on lithium for 7 years and it has done wonders for my mania and insomnia issues.   I do go through short bouts of depression,  but not something I can't power through.   However I was hit with a very long lasting depression that severely hampered my work attendance and aspects of my family life.   My Psychiatrist put me on Lexapro and it did wonders for me.   However,  it really cut into my lithiums ability to control my insomnia and mania.  I was really only getting 1 to 2 hours a day sleep,  if that.   Doc had me halve my dose and it helped a lot.   After a few months I left the lexipro and feel pretty good. I can see that this is not for all.   We all have different needs that is why there are different meds.   Hopefully,  everyone can find their balance.",8,6,1
"Escitalopram","Twitch","August 26, 2018","-","This drug caused me one of the worst times of my life. While it seemed good at first, and I thought it was, people began to see a difference in me. The difference was I entered the manic phase, which lasted for months. It caused me quite a few friendships, my life savings and nearly had me jailed. I have now been off of lexapro for several months and am trying to piece my life back together...if it ever happens. Taking this med led to a living nightmare",1,14,1

It’s been a life changer and helped me and my fellow employees lol. However low libido, has been terrible I feel numb a lot but that does improve and it will be worth it!.

"Escitalopram","Chunky chunk","July 26, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Very disappointed after seeing so many positive reviews and positive drug avg rating! After trying to go the  natural route  which lasted about a year, I found myself spiralling into a hardcore relapse of depression, which is my murky grimy pest. Along with unpleasant ruminations, I just couldn’t stand it anymore. I decided to see my doc and accepted that I need meds. Put me on 10mg. Day one wow! Went into what seems to be a hypermanic episode: increase energy, motivation, sociability, desire to be out there! I really fooled myself into thinking  my gosh I was so imbalanced that it’s gonna help from day one.  Come day 2&amp;3, horrible anxiety! Insomnia! Melancholic features 10 x worse! I even tried 5mg and no difference, everything sucked! I could not stand being like that for 3-4 weeks no way! I would’ve walk out of my job and lost it. I’m gonna see my psych next week and accept I need some kind of mood stabilizer. SSRIs just won’t work for me :(",1,8,1

"Escitalopram","Bel74","June 30, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","It's almost a week since taking 2.5 mg Lexapro in the morning and a quarter seroquel at night.  The first few days I was irritable and very on edge. The third day I had an anxiety attack while watching tv. It came over me slowly, and didn't leave that night.  I have slight hypomania. If I am in a really challenging situation, I still feel slightly vulnerable and anxious. I hope that when my body is used to the medication that will sort itself out. I do have ringing in my ears, which is annoying.  I'm not as hungry, and use the toilet a lot more. I can deal with that. I may even lose some weight, which I've been battling for years now.  I don't think I'll be stopping lexapro. It seems to be getting better.",9,14,1
"Escitalopram","Amby250","May 18, 2016","-","My experience with lexapro has been a very rocky one, to say the least. The beginning symptoms for me were terrible, extreme nausea and vomiting, restless leg syndrome, jaw clenching, and vivid nightmares. After the first day, the nausea and vomiting was gone, and after two weeks my symptoms were manageable. I felt like this medication really helped me with my depression in some ways. I was much more motivated, more sociable, and it helped my anger issues. However, I decided after six months I would like to stop to see if my depression was better. Bad choice. I hurt all over my body so bad, I felt like I was coming down with the flu. I was so dizzy and disoriented I couldn't even function in my daily life. It was a nightmare.",4,9,1
"Escitalopram","Mr Bean","April 24, 2016","-","I'm have been taking Lamotragine and have started on escitalopram for bipolar 2. What an amazing turn around. Where I used to be extremely reactive and explode in to a rage at any little thing I now feel calm and at peace with the world. I have actually started to feel happy. I always suffered from hypo-sexuality and it was so exhausting to be fighting with sexual thoughts and tension constantly. It's such a relief that since being on escitalopram this too has stopped. I now see everything from a much more rational perspective. I've even begun to really feel in love with my wife. Sure, it's one big drawback is that it is an orgasm killer, but I'm finding this is a small price to pay compared to all the benefits. It's given me my life back",9,33,1

I've been having a lot of nauseous, dizzy, racing thoughts, shaking, and headaches. I can't feel a difference yet, but it is my first dose. I have not had an appetite for days now and was hoping this would at least help with the nausea and kind of sick feeling  cause I'm  feeling quite weak.

I went from drinking and drugs 2-4 times a week to waking up at 7 and keeping a schedule. I notice and feel a huge difference in my thoughts, not racing. I noticed that symptom gone immediately.

"Escitalopram","Nicholas5","April 10, 2013","-","<b>Lexapro (escitalopram):</b>			 I wanted to give this medication a go, but was pretty scared at the same time. The reason for that, was because I had used Zoloft (another antidepressant medication in the same class) before with severe anxious mixed manic psychosis. Me and my doctor agreed to be very careful and increase the dosage in small steps. What happens? It brings me complete depression relief and improves all of my anxiety (social anxiety in particular). In the beginning there was some sleep disturbances and initial anxiety, but it subsided quickly. It began to work very fast for me, but maybe it took about 6 months before full effects had come into play. I've never had any episode since then, and no sign of over stimulation either.

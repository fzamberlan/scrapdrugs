"Desvenlafaxine","Porkchoptaco","January 25, 2019","-","Was taking with lamictal for BP2. Wanted to try after having a year of success with Effexor in treating depression 2 years ago. Back then I was under-diagnosed so I took no mood stabilizer. Pristiq was nothing near Effexor to me. Was on 25mg for the past 8 weeks. Week one: insomnia, anxiety, worse mood. Week 2: lifted mood, minor mood swings, mild anxiety, excitability, slight increase in interest in pleasurable activities, slight decrease in confidence, spontaneity, social speaking. Week 3: short, depressive episode, apathy, lethargy. Sleep slightly improved. Week 4: everything from weeks 2&amp;3. Also, MY FIRST PANIC ATTACK! from then on, heightened feelings that I could have a panic attack if I thought about it. Increased anxiety. Stopped taking it. Although I know I was on a very low dose, I just knew that it won’t work for me. I am on day 3 without it and I feel better but I know relapse is coming soon but so is my appointment. Half life: 11 hours. Really???",4,1,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","April 19, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","I started taking this medication along with a mood stabilizer. The mood stabilizer alone didn’t work for my rapid cycling. As soon as I took Pristiq, my cycling stopped and felt ‘normal’ again. No more mania. I’ve been on it 2 years and it’s been amazing! However, DO NOT stop taking this medication as you WILL suffer withdrawal symptoms that I can only imagine feel like coming off meth or heroin.",10,4,1

"Desvenlafaxine","Crazy mum from oz","November 1, 2016","-","After trying many other medications and failing my doctor finally gave me this beauty and my life is much better. I like myself my kids and husband again! Lol.  Not only has it given me back my happiness it also helped me maintain my focus on my weight issues and given me that edge for life i had never ever experienced truly.  Side effects of insomina and suppressed appetite (which is a win when all you do is eat on other meds) First few days heart rate was up but slowed down after the drugs was in my system 100.  Warning! Do not stop taking abruptly!!! You will feel like a herion addict with no hit!",9,8,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Kelli 2112","September 16, 2016","-","Worked great up until Tuesday when I had a sudden attack of dizziness that dropped me to the floor.  This continued for two days and I finally called the doc yesterday who took me off of it.  I went back to lexapro as I had no side effects with it.  It's too soon to tell if I will have any withdrawal from it, but I'm hoping not, I have a busy day at work today.  I'm glad to be off it though, I had a dizzy spell a few minutes ago but it was not bad and stopped quickly.  Guess I'll stick to lexapro and just deal with the depression as it comes.",6,3,1
"Desvenlafaxine","loose cannon2","July 9, 2016","-","I was on lexapro for the depression side of my bipolar, and it stopped working, crying spells at work and agitation.  Doc just switched me to pristiq and so far I seem to be doing well.  I've only been on it 3 days-the only side effect I am having is feeling very drugged, but the sadness is gone and I was able to apologize to someone I lashed out at.   I'm gonna stay on it, even though I feel drugged Im sticking with it.  Im also on latuda and trazadone.  It sure beats the hell I've been through in the past.  I will update in a few months and tell you if I continue to do well.",0,8,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","March 12, 2016","-","I started taking Pristiq 100mg Last July. Initially I had headaches, mood swings, anxiousness and found it hard to sleep. This lasted about a week. With the initial combination of melatonin I was able to get into a routine of taking the pristiq in the morning and melatonin at night, both roughly at the same time to sleep the same amount each day. For nine months I have taken pristiq by itself now and have found that it has significantly decreased anxiety, stopped me from internalising almost completely and has reduced my mood swings considerably. I have slightly reduced sex drive, put on a bit of weight and a want to smoke and fidget. I have found pristiq beneficial to my life but frustrating at times.",9,6,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","November 18, 2012","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 Great medicine! Makes me a bit jittery but a very light dose of anti-anxiety medicines take care of that.",0,9,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Anonymous","April 2, 2012","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 My doctor replaced Prozac with Pristiq in hopes it would be more effective in fighting my depression.  At first I thought I was in heaven.  I'm in my late 50's and never felt this good ever.  I also lost 30 lbs!  As time passed, I became more and more manic. (not a feel good manic either).  Had to get off of it.  Shame.  When it was working for me it was better than anything I've ever tried.",0,19,1
"Desvenlafaxine","ntucker99","March 23, 2012","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 I started taking this medication in conjunction with Lamictal.  Although it is not recommended, my psychiatrist suggested for the first few days I cut the 50mg tablet in half.  I am glad I did.  After reading everyone's reviews about the stomach upset and headaches, I decided it might be beneficial.  I took 25mg for about 6 days then upped to 50mg.  I had slight stomach upset and a few mild headaches.  I take it as soon as I wake no later than 8am.  I have seen a huge reduction in my appetite.  I was a binge eater of sweets before I started and at 5'3' weighed in at 150lbs.  In three weeks I have lost 4lbs.  This is the most stable I have been since I can remember.",0,24,1

After 2 days of being on Pristiq MY WHOLE LIFE changed. I have only been on it for a short time now but I am a whole new happy person. I feel like me again. THANK YOU PRISTIQ!",0,25,1
"Desvenlafaxine","Susan Jarnagin","November 16, 2011","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 Pristiq gives me energy and brings me up from the deep depression when no other anti-depressant can.   I haven't had to take a huge dose to get that effect either, which is fantastic.",0,23,1

"Desvenlafaxine","kitty carryall","May 9, 2011","-","<b>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine):</b>			 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder just a few months ago. I'm 25 and let me say this medicine works great. I could tell a difference within the first week and my husband (whom I was driving absolutely crazy) saw a huge change too. I feel happier now and the manicness has gone away. I have noticed the weight loss but not too much. I was weighing in at 160lbs and now I'm down to 150lbs so 10 lbs in the past 2 months is good. My sex life is back to normal where I hope it will stay. I feel like a better mother and wife now, all because of Pristiq.",0,40,1

"Saphris","Taterbug","March 3, 2020","Taken for 5 to 10 years","I've  been  on saphris for about 6 years or more, in my personal experience I believe I have  been exceptionally well,  when I miss a few days I realize how off I become but go back to normal while I'm on this medication. I think doctors should familiarize  themselves  with this medication  more because I think it would be great for others that suffer with bi-polar  disorder",10,3,1
"Saphris","Anonymous","February 16, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I suffer from Bipolar I Disorder with Psychotic Symptoms. This medication has completely taken away all the voices I was having! I take 20mg and have been for about 5 months. The only thing is my anxiety has increased, and sometimes I feel disconnected and out of it. Does anyone else feel these symptoms? Just curious. Overall though, this drug definitely works.",9,3,1
"Saphris","Peanut","January 14, 2020","-","I’m 59 and have been on and off meds since my 20’s. 10 years ago a new doctor I was going to had put me on Wellbutrin and ambilify. I was still crying all the time and very depressed so he doubled my dose of Wellbutrin to 300 mg.  I started imagining things and crying uncontrollably. Pristiq in the morning and Saphris at night. I had never heard of either one of those drugs and I had tried and failed with a lot of them.  I walked out of there 1 week later with a new lease on life! The Saphris may make your mouth a bit numb because it’s a disintegrating tablet you put under your tongue I don’t get so many highs and lows I stay level and calm. I feel mor patience. I’m not seeing things that I thought I might of caught a glimpse of.  I don’t cry out of frustration all the time.",10,11,1

"Saphris","Jahjah","December 4, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This medication gave me sleep apnoea and I would wake up in the middle of the night not breathing. It wasn’t required in the first place and the withdrawals from this medication are horrid. It might work for some people.. but this is a dangerous drug. Also people mention it makes their tongue numb, this is a common sign you are allergic to something.",1,2,1
"Saphris","ky134340","October 8, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was prescribed asenapine 5mg 2x/day. Was assured by my psychiatrist that it would only make me mildly drowsy. The very first dose hit me hard. Within 40 minutes I was nodding off while trying to talk to people. I slept for ten hours after that. Side note, medications don't typically affect me like that! This made me scared to keep taking it at all, but my psychiatrist said I could just take it at night and see how it went. Over the course of a month, I began feeling extremely agitated (like a mixed episode but worse) and it put me in a dark place. Looking back, I'm honestly surprised that I didn't attempt suicide, that's how bad things got. I'm glad to see that this works for so many, but it's 100% a no from me. For those worried about the taste, it isn't good, but I got used to it after the first dose. It does make your tongue numb, which lasted about an hour for me, but I think it's definitely something you can get used to. I'm quite sensitive to taste and have a sensitive gag reflex, but that aspect was tolerable.",1,15,1

"Saphris","Stay strong","September 4, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I would really recommend this medication because I’ve tried almost every anti psychotic medication and I’ve never been able to stabilize my mood until I found this medication. The only side effect I get from this medication is twitching on my toes but it goes away a few minutes later. I’ve had worst side effects from Latuda which was making me sedated and giving me milk from my breasts and I wasn’t even pregnant. I really like this medication because it also helps me with sleep and without it I over think a lot at night. My mood has definitely improved with this medication I’ve been taking it for 4 years and it’s worked. I’ve only had to increase the dosage 2 times unlike other medications where I constantly have to increase the dosage.",8,17,1
"Saphris","needyyprincess","July 31, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","First night I took it, sent me into a psychedelic dream. it was like a full psychedelic trip. I went into the 4th dimension and was communicating with my past/present/future self all at once. I was everything and everyone. I was matter. energy. I was the universe.  Before this drug, I never dreamt. I slept like a baby, but Saphris completely changed that.I was in full blown insanity, and on and off psychosis for days after the trip.  In my mind, we are all one. so death is nothing. I am everything anyway, this shell of a body I use is not me. waking up felt like I had just come out of a coma, I had no idea who I was, where I was, and how long had passed. one second in our time felt like millions of millions of years in my dreams. I took it for another 3 days, then stopped. to this day the nightmares have never left. Some nights are worse then other. From just this one 'dream', whatever was in that drug changed something in my brain forever.",1,16,1

Since starting Saphris my paranoia has decreased, I’m not distracted with deluded thinking.  I sleep much better, have quit smoking cigarettes, and I’m exercising 4 days a week at the gym. I haven’t had any side effects. I also regularly see my psychiatrist and psychologist.",9,30,1
"Saphris","Seismic One","April 20, 2019","Taken for 2 to 5 years","Yes, Saphris allowed me to finally sleep at night. But after having taken the drug for 2 or 3 years, my speech had become so distorted that I was virtually impossible to understand. Thinking that I may have had a minor stroke (I was in my early 50s at the time), I went to see a neurologist. He is the one who asked me if I were taking any antipsychotic drugs, and told me he believed that I had developed tardive dyskinesia in my tongue from the saphris. I was compulsively moving my tongue constantly within my mouth, and it had destroyed my ability to speak coherently. I immediately stopped the Saphris, then spent the next year diligently and constantly training my tongue to stay put and stay relaxed. My speech is nearly perfect again, with just a very mild lisp that no one but me can hear. But I still spend every moment of every day monitoring where my tongue is, if it’s relaxed, and making sure that it’s not moving. And I’ll be doing that every day for the rest of my life.",1,19,1
"Saphris","AJ","January 16, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was on saphris for less than a month. Made me feel like so bad. Like I had the flu. Also it gave me OCD. I was obsessing over finding pennies. I had a few jars at home too. I was so consumed by this penny obsession. I took off from work so I could organize all my pennies in chronological order. . . ??? This is so bizarre to me. I stopped the saphris not long after. I could not function at all because I was so obsessed with pennies.",1,17,1
"Saphris","HappyToBeHere","November 2, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","First things first, I love this drug! I started out on 2.5 mg and the first time I took it, I actually sat down. And I was able to sit with family and have a conversation, rather than go be in my room to talk with my fantasy world. The first problem that appeared was ankle pain. I’m still unsure if that was the medicine or I actually had injured my ankles, but it went away once I was given 5mg. This medicine makes me feel in control of my emotions, and has actually helped me to feel a bit more organized. The side effects that I have seen is mainly the drowsiness, numb tongue, and weird dreams. Like, really weird dreams. The taste is a bit nasty, but you get used to it quick. I really enjoy this drug and it’s not only me that has noticed a change. It’s my family too, they were originally a bit wary about me going on an antipsychotic, but now they’re glad I did. For me, it’s a miracle drug.",9,31,1
"Saphris","Ksjev","September 23, 2018","-","I was put on Saphris in Jan '17 after I had a Roux-en-Y  Gastric Bypass. My doc wanted to make sure I was able to absorb my meds after surgery. I started at 5 mg and worked my way to 20 mg a night. After a bit it stopped working as effective and I needed a mood stabilizer added to my nightly meds. Using Saphris I found my sexual response and desire to be greatly diminished. Sex was painful while on this med. It took a lot more work to get a response out of me.  I became pregnant in April '18 and with morning (all day) sickness I had a lot of issues with taking meds. I would take it only twice a week or so. I stayed on as much as I could until July when Dr tried to put me on abilify. I've been off of all meds since July. My sexual response and desire has gone back to normal. I liked what it did for my symptoms and for the most part kept me level but after I deliver this baby I will not be going back on Saphris as I enjoy being able to enjoy being intimate with my partner.",6,13,1
"Saphris","TJ","August 31, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","It’s actually pretty good for anxiety. I can definitely say it helped me with most of my anxiety symptoms. I am not manic or  depressed anymore, I’m just zoned out. It is a bit pricey as well.",7,23,1

So far no real problems.  It puts me to sleep straight away which is a godsend and I am much calmer.

"Saphris","BipoPed","July 24, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Took Saphris for about 2 1/2 weeks for Bipolar one mixed w/ Psychotic features.  First time taking it hated black cherry  taste but after that it didn't bother me anymore.  First week was wonderful. High flying mania delight.  Cleaned my house like crazy.  Mania wasn't 'too high' though. Was in a great mood but no major shopping sprees.  Week 2, I started backing down on the cleaning and happiness and started getting agitated mania.  Moods were all over the place.  Cried for an hour after a death in a TV show and felt like I was going to die of grief.  Then it changed to anger and then depression.  Moods were a little scary and rapidly changing. After that, it lessened in intensity but I was still having depression so I decided to come off and try another med.  Also had bad heartburn and gained 5 lb in 2 weeks.  May work for some but not me.",5,18,1
"Saphris","Anonymous","June 26, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","For the first time in 12 months I feel back on track.  My depression and anxiety are gone.  I take it an hour before bedtime.  No weight gain.  Dissolves under your tongue so you can take it anywhere.",10,25,1

It was good for mood but the blurry vision and headaches were more than I could deal with. If it hadn't been for those two side effects I would have stayed on it.

"Saphris","Foureyedgrrl","May 18, 2018","-","I took this medication for a very short time.  Started at 5 mg for a week, then moved to 10mg.  My doctor prescribed it when I was struggling with a poor sleep cycle when I was sleeping only ever other night and eating very little. The taste is awful, but tolerable if the medication would have worked otherwise. It did interrupt the critical sleep cycle.  It worked for that.  I was literally out in 15 minutes. However, I would wake up after 4 hours, literally famished.  I wouldn't be able to fall back asleep until I ate.  I wasn't groggy the next day from the med, but constantly hungry.  Insatiably so. I developed a spasm in my eyelid after 6 days.  At first, I dismissed it.  However, it escalated to every hour.  We then discontinued the medication.  I have been off of it for a week, and still the eyelid twitching has continued every hour. I would avoid this medication due to the fact that tardive dyskenisia can be permanent and large number of patients have reported weight gain.",2,13,1
"Saphris","bpd789","May 17, 2018","Taken for less than 1 month","Saphris was the first drug I tried to treat my Bipolar II. The main reason for it was that weight gain was a big fear for me and I was not willing to jump into any medications that were not weight-neutral. Saphris was weight neutral, but it definitely did not work for me. I took it at night and some nights I would pass out to sleep and others I would sit up awake in my bed feeling like I had no control over my own body. During the day I had a edgy/off feeling like I was coming of a recreational drug. For an hour or two I felt at peace, but that would not last. Definitely not a good fit for me.",2,14,1

"Saphris","mae77","February 1, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I don't currently take this prescription anymore because in the US it is expensive, when I was prescribed for panic attacks and anxiety at a low point in my life oh my god it helped so much, I felt so normal- not strung and feeling doomish, I had clarity mentally and emotionally (with bouts of panic attacks from heavy personal experience, for that I had clonazepam), I was in a good mood and living my own life on saphris, it felt like I had a sudden choice in feeling anxious or upset and I would mentally clear up my anxiety in seconds myself, and no more introspectiveness, the downside: I had anxiety sleeping and rapid crazy nightmares and waking up was a blur the first hour of waking.. I remember this helped a lot and I believe for bipolar (why I took it) it has a positive effect so much, but sleep is harsh on it and it was expensive",9,19,1

He didn't know how to interact with peers, he saw himself as superior to all and totally disconnected from reality. He would stay awake head banging every night. He had huge bags under his eyes and we tried everything we could to get him to sleep. He never slept through the night, and when he was an infant all he did was cry. He is nine now and has been on Saphris for about a year and a half. He is a different person. He was different the first day. He is actually loving towards me and family members and at least tries to interact with other kids. It is a godsend. He  now sleeps 10 hrs",10,32,2

Nightly and over the past 5 months I've slowly tapered down to 10 mg. With high hopes of discontinuing. Saphris got me out of a bad spot, I remember being horrified of answering the door let alone leaving the house I was so delusional. I got out of that spot, SLOWLY got on my feet and SOME WHAT rejoined society. My positive manic spirit is gone, I'm always tired &amp; feel like life goes on around me, not with me. Its very hard to discontinue, I have panic attacks daily now and am beyond stressed. I feel like I'm trapped, no worse--or better--on or off after all these years.",6,10,2

I used to be suicidal everyday &amp; had a hard time leaving the house. Everything was overwhelming.  Since starting Saphris my mind finally feels like it has brakes and my thoughts feel lighter.  I'm feeling true happiness,  even happy to wake up.  Little to no side effects 3 months in. I take it at night because it does make me sleepy. Sugar cravings I've noticed but an trying to control that because honestly this med is giving me my life back.  Cons: 20 minutes of a nasty taste in your mouth because you dissolve it under your tongue. Sugar/carb cravings but no excess weight gain yet.",9,29,2
"Saphris","Finally free of Bp2","September 11, 2017","-","Amazing drug when combined with lexapro ( for my depressive side ). To say it has changed my life, saved my marriage and made me a better father is a sheer undersell of this medicine. I'm bipolar 2 with mixed episodes (Dysphoric).  I'm no longer filled with rage over nothing,   irritable , or depressed.  It has thus far been the magic bullet for me, after trying about 6 other combinations.  It's allowing me to be present in my own life without constantly overthinking or having racing and repeating thoughts.  Having a clear mind is allowing me the freedom to be the man I always knew I was.  There's a lot of horror stories on here but just remember when you find the right medication.  Its worth it.",10,30,2

Then I drew up 12 doodles in under 30 minutes. That night I could not sleep well and began to hear laughing in my room. I was verrrrry manic. When I woke up the next day I worked out at the gym for 3 hours and then went to the park to walk a lap. When I looked in the sky I was seeing UFOs and wondering if they were communicating with me.

I've been feeling like a robot ever since I went on it 6 months ago. I know I should have told my doctor sooner.

After the sleep side effect wore off &amp; it failed to do anything for a depressive episode (&amp; had not helped mixed mania episodes earlier), I discontinued it.  But those 5 months of sleep - they felt really natural, not drugged, easy to wake up from if you had to and go back to sleep, and no grogginess in the morning.  Side effects: slight pinky tremor at times, and it made me produce lots of alive - I would drool like a basset hound on my pillow at night.

By that summer I felt like superwoman, now having the ability to easily go 3-4 nights without sleep or sleepiness.  Explain this to the psychiatrist, he DOUBLED the dose of prescribed Saphris.  I had 4 car accidents that year. All my fault but totally unexplainable. I did not feel inebriated. My mood darkened and by November I tried to commit suicide. I spent 9 days in ICU.

Since starting the Saphris these have stopped, but there are times when he is very stoned acting, like a zombie. He isn't responsive or talkative a lot of the time. His sex drive has also become non existent almost and he suffers from ED when we do have sex.  It's so difficult when you have a disease like BD and then you have to take these meds, which help some of the symptoms but bring on others that are unwanted. It's like what do you do?

This drug, an anti-psychotic MADE me psychotic. It dramatically changed my personally from the moment I took it. I became aggressive and angry at everyone.

I took one Saphris tablet last night per doctor's request, after being off it for some time (as a sleep aid) but felt hung over and a bit depressed most of the day.",1,40,8
"Saphris","Anonymous","May 20, 2010","-","I have been on many Bipolar medicines, Lamictal, Seroquel, Geodon, lithium, also Xanax to help me sleep. I have been on Saphris for one week and started feeling better the next day. I will admit it tastes terrible, but my doctor told me the trick is to take a sweet tart with it, and it isn't so bad. Works for me. My dosage has gone from 5mg to 10 mg, but I'm getting the best sleep I've ever had except for some strange dreams, but I cant complain. The benefits outweigh the taste and dreams any day. I highly recommend this medicine (and a sweet tart!).",10,122,8
"Saphris","Geophory","May 8, 2010","-","Doctor warned me it tasted bad.  Understatement.  HORRIBLE!  Numbs my mouth but is tolerable.  Noticed huge difference the next day.  Mood is great but I slept for 12 hours after first taking it.  I'm sure my body will get used to it and that will stop happening.  I'm supposed to take it twice a day but can't unless I want to sleep 24 hours a day.  I expect to take it twice daily once my body adjusts.  No other side effects except taste and sleep.  Didn't have to use Lunesta for first time in months.",10,30,8
"Saphris","Anonymous","April 25, 2010","-","I started 5mg Saphris 12 days ago and it's UNBELIEVABLE! 20 years ago (on my birthday) I was diagnosed with bipolar that worsened to include severe, treatment- resistant depression. I have done and seen it all - buckets of drugs, ECT and an experimental VNS implant. Mentally, nothing I've tried can touch this stuff! I have also experienced almost every severe physical side effect, and my ADHD-type behavior, noises and shadows are worse (hard to imagine) but I don't think I'll call my doctor on a Sunday. He just gave me 10 of the best days in memory (which is also returning). Will I give piano concerts again? Maybe - if I can play backwards, but I feel so good I could just stand in the corner for the rest of my life.",0,71,8
"Saphris","viperman1029","April 3, 2010","-","I have been severely depressed for six years after coming off my medications in May 2006, due to a bad manic episode. I have tried so many medicines, even the ones that worked before. Nothing could get me out of the dark hole I was in. I went to my Doctor and told him I wanted to try ECT therapy because I was suicidal. He set it up, but asked me to try a new medicine (Saphris) in the mean time. I was willing to try anything. He placed me on 5mg at night, and told me it would probably allow me to eliminate the Ambien for sleep problems. Man, did it. My wife noticed a difference in my mood the next day. I have been on it now for two weeks, and cross my fingers I have not felt this good for twelve years.",10,143,9
"Saphris","Anonymous","March 12, 2010","-","I've been on Saphris about 2 weeks now and the nausea has been terrible, not sure how much longer I'll stick with it. I don't feel I've gotten any better, in fact. Not sure what to do next.",6,24,9

"Saphris","Anonymous","March 1, 2010","-","Been on Saphris for about two months. Taste is bad but the benefits of medicine far outway that. Only side effect is slight numbness in mouth after taking pill but that goes away after about 30 minutes. No other side effects. Racing thoughts, shadows, voices, have now disappeared. First time that has happened in years. Have been able to decrease dosages of other medicines and wean off some all together. So far it has been a miracle drug for me. Feel better now than I ever have.",10,150,9
"Saphris","johneconner","February 22, 2010","-","Dissolves very quickly compared to other sub-lingual tablets that I have taken - tastes horrible though! I have experienced no negative side effects, and it has definitely elevated my mood and taken away the shadows and some of the noises that accompany my diagnosis....overall seems to be much better than the last two meds I was prescribed (Lamictal and Abilify). I give it a ten!",10,75,9
"Saphris","Anonymous","January 18, 2010","-","Saphris does not taste good; it leaves my tongue slightly numb. I've experienced no side effects so far in the 2 weeks I've been on it. I have experienced relief from symptoms from disorders.",10,44,9
"Saphris","Anonymous","December 24, 2009","-","Taking 5 mgs AM &amp; PM. Absolutely no side effects so far. Dosage is sublingual and the pill tastes horrible. Feel definite lift in spirits. Hasn't done much for the obsessions though.",8,55,9

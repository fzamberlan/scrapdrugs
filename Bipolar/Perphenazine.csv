"Perphenazine","fungus","September 3, 2018","Taken for 10 years or more","I was taking perphenazine for about 20 years. When I first started taking it (4mg) I had good results. I had anger problems that greatly improved. However I switched doctors and my dosage was increased to 40 mg. I started getting uncontrolled eye movements. I was given a medication to counteract it. I was on that dosage for many years spending the majority of my time sleeping. Four years ago I decided to take a part time job and slowly stopped taking it. Since then I have had numerous stomach problems including gastro paresis. I don't think the long term side affects were worth it.",2,5,1
"Perphenazine","Tracy","March 25, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I just started this medicine again cause I tried to tough it out again with just sleeping pills.  I hated seroquel I want to be able to move and not gain so much weight I know now it's impossible.  I feel worse or take the consequences.  I have bipolar with psychosis PSTD and severe depression disorder with panic attacks, agoraphobia, I act on an impulse it goes - on and on.  I'd just like to see if you people had any luck. I'm tired  of bad meds. I'm 43 and still praying.",3,8,1

"Perphenazine","REdson","January 17, 2016","-","I was very hot-headed with sudden rage or seething anger all of my life until I got on Perphenezine.  This is an amazing drug.  I NEVER get angry now.  I did get angry once at something which I believe is justified, but I didn't feel deep rage inside.  It went away. I have been on Perphenizine for a year or so now and I feel like a totally different person.  It did take a little while, maybe a few months (I'm not sure) to take effect.  I was psychotic when I first began taking it (delusional).  It is an amazing drug.  Also, I can think more clearly &amp; think better, which is hard to describe.  I can solve problems more easily, analyze situations and it feels as if my engine turned over (brain) and I am smarter now, much smarter.  Amazing!",10,33,1

"Perphenazine","braziej","July 25, 2013","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Have been bi-polar all my life and have major anger issues. Since my doctor put me on perphenazine (4mg daily) my issues have dramatically decreased, but still flare up now and then. The only side effect I found is the lethargy after taking it.",9,26,1

"Perphenazine","Samsquatch","February 23, 2012","-","I was on a very high dose (64mg/day) for two years. At first, it was wonderful. My Dr. told me it was a mood stabilizer, and for me it did just that. For a while. After a few months, I started taking naps in the day - HIGHLY abnormal to me. Then after the naps, I started to go to bed earlier, and earlier. Then one day I realized I was sleeping 17 hours out of the day! Since I followed my Dr's intruction, and we weaned my off, my days are bright again! No naps, chores are getting done, I am not neglecting my hygeine, picking up forgotten hobbies, living, THRIVING!  And absolutely no withdrawl.",6,27,1
"Perphenazine","Anonymous","July 26, 2011","-","<b>Trilafon (perphenazine):</b>			 I have been on Trilafon for 2 years now. Mostly I liked it at first because it brought me back to earth when I was over anxious. I have lowered my dosage since then and I thought it was doing me well, but I have been having neck problems lately and have realized that this is a side effect of Trilafon called extra-pyramidal syndrome that damages my posture area, so no matter how hard I try I can't regain a good posture.",0,35,1
"Perphenazine","Anonymous","April 7, 2011","-","This has been helpful with the anxiety and mood swings.  Doesn't seem to have as much as an antidepressant effect as Abilify did for me.",8,19,1

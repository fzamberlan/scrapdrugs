"Paliperidone","Tom","April 4, 2020","-","paliperidone is  the only medication I take for bipolar. A monthly injection of 100mg. It has single handily stopped me from going back to hospitals, there’s no psychosis.  I’m often on the side of depression though, feeling empty of emotions. This is where I try to think that this is how normal people feel without a condition of bipolar or schizophrenia. I’ve become more reliable. I don’t get suicidal thoughts, I’m no longer a danger to myself or others which I could be in psychosis. Relationships I have now are more secure. To summarise, it’s changed my life’ I no longer worry about hospitals and losing everything. Do I miss the highs? Yes. Do I miss the damage I inflicted on relationships and myself. No. Also there are benefits to an injection and a cto order. I know I would never agree to taking medication in the long run. I’d stop talking it to feel the highs - good luck",8,0,1
"Paliperidone","Kevin","March 19, 2020","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I been taking paliperidone for 10 months and it was the worse thing of my life. Had the injection and it was awful. The drug shuts down your brain and your dopamine receptors. It takes away my sex drive and left my with no happiness. Takes away all the joy in your brain. Horrible drug that should be banned. Its a dirty drug with lots of horrible side effects.",1,1,1
"Paliperidone","ASpurr78","February 29, 2020","-","So I had initially went on Paliperidone around 2 years ago (April 2018) and I was on the 6mg pill for Schizo-Affective disorder bipolar type along with 300mg Trileptal.  I went from 236lbs to 293lbs as of present.  During this time, I switched from the pill to the injection, at 234mg IM.  So at one point, my doctor thought I may have just a case of bipolar disorder and so inpatient I went and got switched to Lithium.  That seemed to better treat my mood, and the decrease started from 234mgs to 117mgs.  The weight hasn’t come off yet, but I’m thinking more clearly and morning erections are coming back.  I do tend to sleep lightly.  Still, I don’t have much energy and much motivation to engage in hobbies, although I am going on vacation for a second time in 6 months so that’s a positive.  I think I’ll be on the 78mg injection of Invega sometime after next week.   I’m hoping to get my life back after 20 years of crappy antipsychotics.  I seem to tolerate lithium well enough.",5,1,1
"Paliperidone","Jellybaby_30","February 15, 2020","-","had 5 shots of  this paliperidone after I had a manic episode. Since going off of it I never feel tired. But get 12 hours sleep a night. Can’t zone out get high or drunk. I get a lot of headaches. Have no sex drive and feel numb. So I forget about sex, very low motivation. So it’s hard to get motivated to shower or do laundry it used to be really easy.  I used to clean the house all the time. But now no dopamine reward. Weight gain, lower intellect.  It's hard to have conversations now because I can’t think as fast. Thoughts of what to say don’t seem to come to me anymore. Long term and short term memory is screwed. Always forget things. Don't enjoy my hobbies and interests. Eg I watch a movie and my face and soul is just blank/numb. Couldn’t cry for 5 months now I finally can. Sadness, happiness, love, anger, fear, jealousy have come back a little bit. Hardly any food tastes nice anymore miss calling my friends and chatting but get scared because I hardly talk anymore.",1,9,1
"Paliperidone","Queen92","January 28, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was on the injections for two  it made me gained a lot of weight and  felt uglier, I felt terrible about myself they took me off in August 2019 and put me on the pills in 2020 I would not recommend this medication!!",0,1,1
"Paliperidone","Queen","January 17, 2020","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I was put on invega in May of 2019 in my hospitalization stay. A few days later I was throwing up constantly. Exactly one month later, I was rushed to the emergency room with low count white blood cell and was diagnosed with sepsis. I almost went into septic shock twice. Invega caused me to have sepsis. DO NOT EVEN TAKE THIS MEDICATION.",1,1,1
"Paliperidone","Gaz 1111","December 31, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","I was forced on this injection when I was hospitalised and told that if I didn't take it I would stay in hospital indefinitely. I have put on a lot of weight and I sleep most of the time, I have no motivation to do anything I get jittery legs when I try and sleep and I can't be bothered to do anything. I used to be passionate about a lot of things but I now feel like everything is a chore I have lost all my social skills and lack my personality it has all been stripped away from me I've been on the injection for around 6 or 7 months and I am going to refuse to take it when I get my driving licence back as I had that taken away from me as well. I have lost my sex drive as well.  Totally against this horrible drug Do not take.",1,5,1
"Paliperidone","Bri’","December 10, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I’ve been going in and out of states of dissociation since taking Invega ER. Feeling terribly uncomfortable and depressed. Ugh",0,4,1
"Paliperidone","Jay","November 2, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","So I was first was prescribed paliperidone whilst I was in hospital and I was receiving the injection. I believe my first was around the 75 dose, and at the start things were fine. It was only when they bumped up the dose to 150 is when I started to notice some unusual sensations throughout my body. Tingling like pain started through my legs and arms and over the months it has gotten worse. Even now, I can still feel pain within my legs and it annoys the hell out of me. My last shot of this drug was down to 100, and my condition hasn't improved. I don't know what's causing all this pain throughout my body, but it's gotta be the drug. On top of that, I've got really bad anxiety and agitation that is stopping my everyday life, something I haven't had before which again I blame this drug for it. I think people with Bi-polar should stay away from this drug, it causes a lot of harm if things don't go your way.",1,7,1
"Paliperidone","CaribbeanGirl","October 23, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Been on a monthly injection of InVega for 4 months now.  I agree with most of the other comments that while it stopped the hallucinations, it has left me void of all emotion or personality.  I feel numb most to all of the time, I’ve gained a lot of weight (maybe 30 lbs so far), it has sapped me of all energy, severe anhedonia, apathy, weakness and depressed.  I’m very torn, I don’t want to continue this medication but it has kept me out of the hospital for 4 months.",3,5,1
"Paliperidone","Blip","October 9, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","This drug has completely ruined my life.  I was a driven illustrator and designer. I can’t believe how they treated me like absolute trash. Overnight this drug took my life from me and it flipped every personality trait. It’s  been about 10 months since I stopped it and I’m still in a deep depression mourning the loss of myself. Everything that made me me was taken away. My passion, creativity, sense of humour, can do attitude, energy, self care, intelligence, joy, motivation, strength, positivity, rationality etc. The human brain isn’t equipped to deal with this much change.",0,11,1
"Paliperidone","Father","July 17, 2019","-","This paliperidone is miracle drug to my 15 yr old daughter, she’s diagnosed with bipolar last Dec 2018 . She’s on paliperidon 3 mg for 5 months and works great for her . With a minimal side effects a little weight gain. All in all this is the best meds for her. She is back to her normal life again . Good luck everyone!",10,8,1
"Paliperidone","Danjwp","March 2, 2019","-","I was given this drug to control hypomania - I was given 150mg monthly depot.  It absolutely destroyed my life. I became, within a couple months, severely depressed and severely socially anxious. Yes, I was hypomanic to begin with, but the change was from happy in mood, to an absolute wreck. The mental pain I experienced for a year and a half was the worst for a period of about 6 months. It seemed my only motivation and energy was being directed towards my wish to die. I just couldn’t live with the unrelenting mental pain.  The dose has since been lowered by one third, I am feeling much better now. Far more social and in a less depressed mood. I still want to lower the dose further, down to say, 50mg because I am still somewhat depressed.",1,13,1
"Paliperidone","Otis1","November 10, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Been on risperidone 6 mg for many years. Doc took me off and put me on invega sustenna 128. On 4th month. Much less foggy in the brain. Lost 10 lbs, sex life back. Very grateful for Invega",10,6,1
"Paliperidone","Tommy","October 17, 2018","Taken for 1 to 2 years","The pros - it eliminates mania and psychosis- you can experience a new steady life patterns.  The negativity - weight gain, loss in interest in things you like before, happiness seems unattainable and some suicidal thoughts, numbness in limbs at night.  I scared myself with my last episode so taking it gives me confidence it won’t happen again. I get regular sleep. Maybe I miss the highs of bipolar or it’s changed my personality.  I won’t take risks anymore - it’s been 1 year and it’s working better than any anti psyc med, but not sure if it’s too strong for bipolar. I probably would stop taking it but on a CTO order’ hoping for a reduction from 150 to 100 injection - wishing you good luck",8,9,1
"Paliperidone","Matty","June 5, 2018","Taken for 1 to 6 months","I'm on the shot and didn't sleep first night.  It works great do not twitch so much. Love the shot",8,3,1
"Paliperidone","HannahBanana100","May 30, 2018","-","While using this drug (invega, injection) I gained 25 pounds and I think I am still gaining weight. I am 5'6 and 180 lbs. I feel a lack of motivation in the things that used to give me joy. I just no longer feel like doing them or even being social. I avoid social situations. I have a very irregular sleep pattern and cannot take caffeinated coffee in the morning anymore. My doctor told me she would not treat me unless I took this medication. That doesn't seem like this medication is working well for me. Before I took this I was taking resperidone and weighed 155 lbs and was highly motivated to work out and pursue my creative endeavors. I don't like psychiatrists as they do not really seem to listen to valid reasons for not wanting to take specific drugs and not switch to something else. My quality of life has really gone down, just because its easier for her to have someone give me a shot for one month. Now I feel at risk for diabetes.",1,16,1
"Paliperidone","Hem","May 2, 2018","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Invega 78mg is good.  I had no cognitive problems, good energy, minimal weight gain.  However the prolactin is high 150ng/ml and worrying me. I wish to stay on this medication but don’t have low bone density from lack of periods and high prolactin seems like a trade off. Invega causes me to stay happy and without worrying. I am worried if I leave this high prolactin for 20 more years what will be the ramifications.",8,5,1
"Paliperidone","Anonymous","March 6, 2018","-","The drug eliminated my psychotic symptoms which is good. The problem is taking the drug when those symptoms subside. I had rapid weight gain in only three doses of 156mg and gained over 40 lbs! I stopped taking it because of this. It is extremely frustrating as I haven’t lost any weight yet and have been off of it for a few months. BEWARE of this drug if you need it monitor your weight because I gained it overnight. I’m angry that my doctor didn’t warn me of this happening or monitored my weight. He doesn’t care he just wanted money. Don’t 100% trust your doctor or take medication all the time unless absolutely necessary.",3,6,1

"Paliperidone","Archangel Michael","September 20, 2017","-","I have Bipolar 1 with Psychosis and began receiving the 170 mg monthly injection and have not had any psychosis or noticeable mood swings since. My head is no longer filled with racing thoughts or voices from God. I no longer connect everything together like a never-ending string theory.  I'm no longer paranoid or fearful. I no longer have a sense of impending doom. And I can now sleep all through the night, although I now have the craziest dreams, including astral projection and lucid dreams which is kind of cool, but sometimes scary. The biggest problems from this medication are that I have gained 40 pounds in 2 years and it levels me out so much that I can't be super happy about great things that happen in my life and it's impossible to cry. I'm just mostly neutral.",8,7,1
"Paliperidone","anon33jay","August 19, 2017","-","this medication simply does not work! I have been on it for 7+ years and I have only gotten worse. my symptoms have gone from mild to severe. All they do is increase the dosage and now I'm on the maximum dose. I relapsed last week and I found myself wandering around aimlessly in a parking lot. I have become more paranoid and delusional. Not to mention the side effects- uncontrollable bowel movements, extreme tiredness, low energy, low libido, muscle pain, chest pain, ect, ect... It is almost impossible to get off this medication once you are on it for a while. I've talked to my doctor- sent him letters and he will not change the medication. And I've called other p-docs and no one can see me or even answer the phone. Time for a switch.",3,3,1
"Paliperidone","Findaway2","March 2, 2017","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Been on this for 11 months for my bipolar 1. Side effects have been very minimal compared to other anti-psychotic's I've been on. I'm on the 156mg every 28 days. I also take topamax, cogentin &amp; melatonin. I feel slowed down compared to when I was living in a manic state, but I'm trying to get used to it. It's not a sleepiness but a lack of mania I feel. But I do feel sleepy between 5:30 &amp; 7pm I'm guessing that's when the sustained part of the medication kicks in. I have had some moderate weight gain. I have had severe problems with muscle rigidity with other anti-psychotics, so I am super happy to find I don't have to go through that with invega sustaina! It did give me a big knot in my arm, so I get it in my butt now &amp; that's worked out better!",9,8,1

In the beginning, I experienced extreme lethargy, bloody nose, and a constant stuffy nose, I almost quit the pill, until, I found some reviews telling me to wait it out- and I'm glad I did.

However after a week. I feel that it's not helping. I don't go to sleep till like midnight now. And I am not stable anymore. I think I may need a higher dosage. I have made a couple apt this week but they where cancelled due to them closing for weather and a emergency. But my mania is out of control. I have bad outburst. Do things I know I shouldn't.

I'm always happy and am no longer irritable since being on this medicine. I don't have a problem with alcohol abuse anymore and I'm able to drink like a normal person.

Side effects were - nausea briefly -  restlessness that might keep waking you up at night. Both of these went away. I was told by my psych that I might feel shaky but that should pass. Positives so far are less rumination and constant thinking. Less daydreaming. It doesn’t affect my actual ability to think. I haven’t gone manic on this yet. My temperament seems to be even and my energy level is good. I'll check back in in a month with the 10mg review. Thanks all.",0,9,1

Within the first night of taking it, I was up with vomiting and diarrhea to the point I was glued to the toilet. I was so weak I could not even stand up without getting dizzy, chills, and nauseated. I would nearly pass out anytime I even moved. I was stuck in bed for a whole week and had to miss work. I did not notice any good effects, but since I was so sick I wasn't particularly paying attention to my mental status. I only took the meds for 3 days before I had to stop because I literally could not function. I hope this was not a common occurrence and others are able to get relief from this medication- but for me it brought on very very bad side effects.",1,2,1

I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds. Guess I was hooked on the buzz. Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly. Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it? Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back. They don't care for my complaint.   A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay.

After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify.

I have been taking this med  Abilify for about a month now, so long enough. I switched to this from Zyprexa, and that switch was rough. My anxiety came back worse than before on this med and the restlessness was too much for me. I took 5mg and I would get an hour or two of sleep per day and not be able to sit still during the day. I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot.

Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.  And now I can say that although it may not have been as effective as when I first went on it, it definitely made a difference!  Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.  It wasn't until last night I put the connection to me not being on anything.  I gained a little weight on it, but at the same time,  I allowed myself to eat what I wanted and didn't exercise.

I didn't change my eating or exercising habits) In 2017 my new psychiatrist changed medications and I dropped 41 pounds in two years the Abilify slowed my metabolism.

My doctor had me on 2, but I felt like it made me feel apathetic and kind of dissociated, so I began cutting the pill in half.  I did notice that I felt less depressed, could focus better, and did not experience such strong mood episodes.   However, within a month I was experiencing this extremely intense paranoia that I never had before.  I had chest pains and headaches regularly.  I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.  My doctor had me convinced the medication wasn't causing the paranoia, it was just me, but as soon as I stopped taking it the headaches, chest pains, and bursts of anxiety have stopped.

The one thing I would like to say to others who have written comments here is, do not say you would not recommend this to someone because it doesn't work for you. That is the reason there are different medications, and just because it doesn't work for you, it is ridiculous for you to say you wouldn't recommend others take it.",0,192,13
"Aripiprazole","Anonymous","August 28, 2008","-","<b>Abilify (aripiprazole):</b>			 Abilify has been useful to me in terms of sleep and improving my insomnia, but I still have to be treated with a mood stabilizer, like Lithium, in order to keep my bipolar episodes under control. The good news is that it did not cause (I was at 10MG daily) weight gain like Zyprexa. Good luck to all of you!",0,68,13

"Aripiprazole","Voo","June 21, 2008","-","<b>Abilify (aripiprazole):</b>			 This is a good antipsychotic and does well for bipolar disorder. I was on 20mg per day when I suffered a severe manic episode, so it is possible to have episodes while on the medication, but I should point out that I was not taking it every day as I was supposed to.  The only side effects I get from this are restlessness, anxiety and slight tremors.",0,71,13

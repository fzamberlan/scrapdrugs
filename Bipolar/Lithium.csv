"Lithium","Paulineeb","March 13, 2020","Taken for 10 years or more","I have been on Lithium for fifteen years and I can honestly say it didn't help all that much but I stayed on it because it's supposed to be the Gold Standard treatment for Bipolar Disorder. Now that I'm being weaned off from it I can see that it was actually making me worse. I was on 1200 mg. and I'm down to 600mg and feeling much better. Gone is my depression, my anxiety, my diarrhea, my lack of concentration etc. etc. etc. I wish I had known this years ago, I am going off from it now as my kidneys will fail if I stay on it much longer.   My previous Psych. Doc. would not use it as he saw way too many kidney failures at about the 15th-20th years while he was a resident.   Please know that this drug is not without dire consequences eventually in time your kidneys will fail, if you don't believe it see a kidney specialist don't let your doctor pooh pooh this statistic.  Please make an informed decision, and do what is right for you.",2,20,1
"Lithium","etherealmoon","February 4, 2020","Taken for 2 to 5 years","I can safely say that Lithium has changed my life for the absolute best and has been an absolute miracle pill for me. I'm a whole new person and finally I am always who I was supposed to be. I finally want to live and love life and myself again. I've been taking lithium for around 3 years and started off low with 300 mg, then 600 mg for a long time, and just now going to 900 as my blood tests show I am low on lithium. The only down side is having to get blood tests to check that everything is okay with your kidneys as that is where it is processed, but it's not a big deal at all at the cost of having my life back again. I'm no longer a crazy, mean, suicidal mess and now a nice, loving, stable, and content human being! Don't get me wrong, I'm not perfect and still deal with a lot but lithium just takes the edge off and makes me be able to tolerate my bipolar II. I also take Prozac at 60mg for depression and Klonopin 2mg for anxiety. So glad to have my life and myself back again!",9,31,1

"Lithium","hi","December 11, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was prescribed 450mg of Lithium to take in conjunction with 200mg of Lamictal and 300mg of Wellbutrin due to still experiencing irritability, impulsivity, and paranoia from bi polar. The psychiatrist who prescribed this to me said that it was  the cure  for bipolar to combine Lithium and Lamictal so I was eager to try it. I was only on it for 5 days. I had to stop because my job requires me to drive a lot, and I was getting tired early on in the day, almost to the point of  being drowsy like I was on a high dose of Xanax or something. Also, after looking up all the long term side effects , I wasn’t too thrilled about taking it anymore anyway. However I will say my mind was much clearer on this medication and it made me more articulate. I was still pretty irritable though. My new psychiatrist added 100mg of Lamictal in the morning along with the  200mg of Lamictal at night so we’ll see if that helps.",6,20,1
"Lithium","Scooby","December 9, 2019","Taken for 5 to 10 years","Bipolar / adhd. I take Lithium, 300 mg morning, 900 mg night, Epival (Valproic Acid) to stabilise the Bipolar. It's amazing! If head ache, a dab of salt on the tongue, it's gone! No mood swings, no numbness, no memory loss, I got my life back. There's a 1 hr window to take bipolar pills, if forgotten, I'll get moody or excited, once taken, I'm back to calm and happy. For Adhd, I use Concerta. It's amazing! I'm learning to live with adhd  (my brains needs glasses (for children), My brains needs glasses again (for adults)). I learned about the VAGUS NERVE, a nerve directly linked from the stomach to the brain / vise-versa. Self-help books can heal you from head to toe. In conclusion. I adore Lithium, yes I gained some weight,   began a thyroid gland problem ,but will be off Synthroid, some doctors give it for prevention. No other issues with Lithium, nor Epival, nor Concerta. Perfect combination thanks to my psychiatrist!",9,18,1
"Lithium","XavierM","November 30, 2019","Taken for less than 1 month","I was diagnosed bipolar type I 9 years ago and had 3 acute mania during these 9 years. Most of the time I was very depressed with suicidal thoughts. Anger bursts, high irritability (light, noise especially). Tried aripiprazole, pregabalin, valproic acid, clopixol, quetiapine, even cbd, all more awful that each of them (except cbd which is a bit calming but not so efficient after a few days, very expensive and nothing compared to lithium). Lithium was a revelation and calmed my mind immediately without making me feel a zombie. I'm a more calm and relax person with far less anxiety while being even more focused. Lucky. I've even stopped cutting the skin under my feet. Miraculous drug for me at 600mg extended release of carbonate. Lithium is a powerful element, it might not suit you but you should discuss this option with your doctor if you feel no drug works for you.",10,28,1

"Lithium","Ashley","November 19, 2019","-","I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II at 18 and I am now 27. Since my teens I’ve had debilitating, mostly  mixed  depression and with suicidal ideation, self harm behaviors (cutting), and a few hospitalizations from suicide attempts. I tried multiple antidepressants (Zoloft, Prozac, Cymbalta, Effexor), mood stabilizers (Lamictal, Latuda,  Depakote), atypical antipsychotics (Seroquel, Abilify), and finally, Lithium, which I discontinued after two weeks because I didn’t feel a change.  Five years later, I decide to try Lithium again as a last resort. I forced myself to stay on it for at least 3 months because I read it takes several weeks to notice a difference. Nine months later and I’m on Lithium 900mg and I have ZERO suicidal thoughts, no interest in self harm (completely foreign to me now), no crying spells, low mood, etc. I experienced it’s full efficacy at 4 months with minimal side effects. Lithium changed my life. For first time in my life I feel healthy emotionally.",10,43,1
"Lithium","BipolarMeds","November 18, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","After being diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2003, I have taken Lamotrigine, Divalproex Sodium, Clonazepam, Risperidone, Olanzapine, Abilify, and more recently Seroquel. I wish you the same luck with finding the best treatment plan, and even though Lithium didn't work for me, it may work very well for you. I recently tried Lithium and by the end of the first week I felt nauseated and had developed diarrhea at 150mg. Increasing the dose to 300mg worsened these side effects and I felt like I had a bad case of the flu that caused me to go back to bed several days after awakening and depression set in. Increasing to 450mg caused the most severe depression. After speaking with my doctor, we discussed to decrease to 300mg and then try to  maintain that, but unfortunately the depressive thoughts didn't end, even after reducing to 150mg for the final week for a total of a six week trial. It wasn't until about three weeks after I stopped Lithium that I broke out of the depression and feel better.",1,8,1

My doctor prescribed it because he thought it would help with the suicidal thoughts related to my bipolar depression. While I was on it, I felt very strange and almost out of my body. I gave it a good go, but eventually I decided that the strange feelings in my body and brain were too much to take.

"Lithium","Anonymous","November 12, 2019","Taken for 6 months to 1 year","Was on lithium for about 8 months for my bipolar. To be fair to lithium I was on a cocktail of meds at the time so I can’t say too much except that I was also on topamax, depakote, Effexor, ambien, all at once. I saw a picture of myself and I looked like I had had a stroke. My doc said I looked great. I think the depakote messed up my hormones because my stomach bloated like I was 7 months pregnant. The man at the store I bought cigs from said I sucked if I was smoking when pregnant and I said I am for sure I am not! Anyways the doc didn’t think to test my blood levels so who knows what that whole 8 months was a haze.  I was new to a bipolar diagnosis so I didn’t know that the doc was a quack. I can’t even remember what dose I was on. Anyways that was when I took lithium so I can’t say what I think truly experienced because of the cocktail. Otherwise it may have been a good fit. I wouldn’t take again because I have hashomotos.",1,4,1

My bipolar disorder was out of control when I finally received my diagnosis. Lithium was the first medication I was prescribed for this mental illness. I’ve added and subtracted additional medications over the years, but I’ve never left Lithium. My psychiatrist and I both agree it works extremely well in my case. It does manage mania better than depression, so I’m on another prescription for my  lows.  I did have side effects on the immediate release tablets, but once I switched to ER, the only thing I noticed was acne.

I couldn't remember ever being happy if I wasn't manic. I had an emptiness that consumed me and left me wanting to end it all. I had tried every medicine- with one doctor recommending shock therapy- until Lithium. Lithium gave me my old self back, to the point where I feel no trace of my disorder. The cons: My stomach gets queasy after I take it, so I take it at night. My thyroid has been negatively affected, so I now have to take Synthroid. The pros: I am happy again, I am functional again, and I no longer feel like a burden. Definitely try it, especially if you've tried everything like I have. Feel better :)",9,29,1

I feel like myself, and hadn't since over 2 years ago when I was diagnosed. I would give it a 10 if not for the side effects and necessary bloodwork. When I first got on, I noticed it felt like my legs were giving out when I was walking. First 2 months on it had significant hair loss but don't experience it anymore. I think it made me lose about 5 lbs. Gave me moderate  acne which is improving but I also went on spironolactone for the acne... if you can deal with the side effects, it's pretty great!",8,17,1
"Lithium","FluX","October 11, 2019","-","I was diagnosed at 23 with bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features and placed on lithium almost immediately I felt improvement and my mania subside. It works great for mania and mixed episodes however in my case not so much for depression, lithium has saved my life. It takes away the issues of suicidal thoughts and suicidal ideation in between episodes for me and racing thoughts well. It's about as stable as stable is for me considering having bipolar disorder. I am now 26, I had to stop it due to it having damaged my thyroid. Even so I have decided after almost 6 months off it and having tried every medications available, but I would rather have whatever time stable with this medication and risk that than the destructive episodes. The side effects I initially experience are: light hand tremors, nausea, diarrhea. These go away. The long term side effects I have are: emotional blunting, lethargy, Increased thirst, more frequent urination and cravings for salt.",10,16,1
"Lithium","Serica","September 29, 2019","Taken for 1 to 6 months","Lithium is nice, but it does have little price to pay.

However, it does make me thristy (I mean water is healthy so it's not bad) and numbs my emotions.  I don't feel any happiness or sadness, nor am I capable of love. My personality hasn't changed however, and I still appears to be the same in front of others, only calmer.

Now that I am on it after having so many episodes, all I can say so far after trying it myself and reading all these good responses is that I wish that I tried it sooner. My head feels clearer, I respond faster. It doesn't feel heavy like other psychiatric drugs which makes me feel worried because I think will it actually stop me from being manic again. I am on 400mg going up to 600mg lithium and 350mg clopixol depot injection every week. Trying lithium is the last result as I have tried almost every thing else. I have been to prison due to my mania, my mania gets pretty bad so I had to give this ago despite the things I've heard, I don't want to go back there ever again so this is my last hope.

I also have no side effects at this dosage range. It is the only medication (I've tried all mood stabilizers, most antipsychotics, many SSRIs, and others) that has enabled me to achieve real remission. Other meds have helped, but they only masked the underlying problem. I have bipolar I and for the first time since my diagnosis 15 years ago, I have been episode free for more than a few months, actually it's been about 2 years now! Even at low therapeutic levels, lithium can help the brain protect and repair itself. This is backed up by scientific studies.

I was worried about what this medication would do to my body, my kidneys etc., and more superficial concerns about weight gain and hair loss. I have been taking lithium for approx 1.5 years now. Aside from a very slight tremble when I sometimes drink, the side effects have been minimal. I'd estimate I have put on approx 1 stone since starting the medication, but that is something that I am in a good mindset now to tackle, and think I can lose.  No problems so far with skin and sun sensitivity. The regular blood tests are important, and come around quickly, but so far results have been in the normal range. I feel like I have my life back. My marriage was in real danger, I couldn't enjoy parenting my children, now I feel I am back in control.

I've been deeply sad and broken. I've shut down emotions out of fear of being unemployable and not being able to care for my other children. This 30 years compressed into a deadly human, edgy and angry. So I started taking over the counter lithium, 5mg, and felt my brain swirl into a fluid relaxed state, like a lava lamp, or shimmering mirages over a landscape. Then I bought 50g of lithium chloride, a simple salt of lithium, like sodium chloride. I put 10-20 mgs of this in a carafe of water and drink it throughout the day. The water tastes very good. To close this, I want to make it clear to everyone that lithium is an essential element that everyone needs. If you don't get enough from your environment you will have lithium deficiency.

"Lithium","NHelm","March 8, 2019","-","My diagnosis is Bipolar I with PTSD. I have a tendency toward mixed episodes and psychotic features. I found relief with lithium when nothing else worked. Other drugs like Lamictal gave me horrible cognitive side effects. I couldn't finish sentences or remember things that happened minutes ago. That was not the case with Lithium. I took Lithium for the first time during inpatient for a severe mixed episode and the difference was like night and day. It was like taking a painkiller when in severe pain. Within thirty minutes I felt what I can only describe as RELIEF. I've never had such a rapid and drastic reduction in symptoms. There is a reason Lithium is considered the gold standard in treating bipolar disorder. Everyone is different and some experience bad side effects with little relief on this medication, however I would recommend at least trying it if your doctor prescribes it. The only side effect I experience is increased thirst- a small price to pay for getting my life back.",10,44,2
"Lithium","Danjwp","January 25, 2019","-","I have bipolar 2 disorder and my psychiatrist prescribed me lithium. Have already been on antipsychotics but we were intending on switching medication. I also have PTSD. Day 5 on lithium and it has noticeably made my PTSD and associated ‘mental pain’ far worse and far more distracting and disabling. The effects of this is reduced motivation, increased tiredness, loss of smooth social skills, impaired cognitive functions. It’s not as severe as you may think, I can still function, but it has made living less pleasant and made it harder to get things done. I also experienced hand tremors for a few minutes which were unpleasant. Overall I would say it has an emotional numbing effect which detaches you from feeling things strongly so it is more difficult to function and interact with life. If you experience mania and say experience happiness far too strongly it could be helpful, but other medications (antipsychotics) are better (in my experience).",2,18,2

"Lithium","chrisdavis1973","July 31, 2009","-","Lithium is going to slow you down. If you enjoy your Mania you won't like this much but if your mania makes you unhappy, this is your one big break. Schedule time off from work if you can or at least scale back on your social calendar until you get used to the drug. After a few weeks you will have adjusted and you'll be able to get back to your happy routine.",8,42,11
"Lithium","wonderly","June 23, 2009","-","After almost dying of chronic alcoholism I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on lithium in May 2006 (currently on 750 mg per day). I was also taking Seroquel and Imipramine.  I put on 50 lbs and my wife kept commenting on how I was listless and zoned out.  This was a big problem because I write fiction for a living, which requires energy and alertness.  With my doctor I started tweaking the Seroquel and Imipramine and finally quit them altogether (the info sheets for both state they may result in weight gain). The weight is melting off, I'm off the booze and feel great.  Life hasn't been this good in a long time.",8,60,11

It also took a large dosage to get to therapeutic level and then I had allergic reactions to it, vomiting, tremors, disorientation, etc. If it works for you, apparently from others I've talked to, it really does; if it doesn't it really doesn't.",0,28,11
"Lithium","threeicys","May 2, 2009","-","I have tried other medicines for Bipolar Disorder and some worked and some did nothing. Lithium made me feel strangely dull and sleepy the first two weeks but I wanted to give it a good chance. Around the 15th day, I woke up and felt fine, two months later I still feel fine. I am also taking 15mg of Buspirone and 20mg of Celexa. I never thought I would be able to really live until now. My moods are not extreme anymore and I don't have suicidal thoughts. It is like a switch was slipped.  My doctor started me at a very low dosage of Lithium, I am so glad she did - I only need 300mg once a day.",9,71,11

Finally I went to a shrink and he worked with me until the medication Tegretol brought me out of the depressed state and I went manic. The doctor upon knowing this manic state, prescribed 900mg of lithium per day with the 400mg of Tegretol and I have been normal for 15 years. I have to take these medicines forever. If I stop because I feel good, watch out. I either go manic or down in the dumps again and I don't wish that on my worst enemy.",10,155,12

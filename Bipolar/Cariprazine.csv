I have been on it for a few weeks and I think this is the one that will change my life. I have a good level of mental energy for the first time ever (but not wired, like a stimulant), I suddenly have no problem motivating myself to do the things I want to do, I don’t have the urge to overeat, and I am a happier, more cheerful person. I have had none of the extra pyramidal or cognitive side effects, but it did make me a little bit hypomanic at first and has made my sleep very fragmented, so I have had to take Saphris some nights to bring me down and help me sleep. All of the bad reviews and potential side effects made me scared to try it for a while, after having had a bad experience with another atypical antipsychotic, but the benefits have far outweighed any mild side effects I’ve experienced.",0,37,1

Bottom line I am really glad I got over my fears and took it. I'm no longer depressed but I am feeling things now after a long time.

I got really hungry so I joined weight watchers to track my food intake and get advice. I eat a ton of fruit and drink water all day. It's forcing me to be healthy. I have lost weight and not gained.

With all that running I still managed to gain 25lbs. I would barely sleep 3 hours a night. I eventually wrecked my car and was hospitalized, doctors told me I additionally had akathisia and medicine induced psychosis. Once I came off this drug I felt a total difference in my mood. I'm now on Prozac and Buspar and while I still have depression I can manage most days. No more manic or psychotic episodes.",1,1,10
"Cariprazine","Sudo","June 25, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I will update after I've been on longer, but I basically feel stoned, very hard time sleeping, feel like I was hit by a truck and my teeth HURT. Mentally I feel no difference, but do feel more friendly. Thankful I have insurance because it's $1200 for a month supply.",0,14,11

On the 4th day I developed  Akathisia which was quite miserable. discontinued after this occurred. If you feel like this is starting I'd stop immediately!",0,26,11
"Cariprazine","tessamess","May 31, 2016","Taken for 1 to 6 months","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 It worked for me. In the beginning I thought it wasn't working, but it was just building up I guess. I was still having auditory hallucinations when I did too much stuff and didn't sleep properly, but that was just me. The Vraylar stopped my delusions of  everyone is trying to modify me or everyone is plotting to put me in the mental hospital. I am getting along fine with everyone now! Unfortunately, even with the copay, I can't afford it. So I'm switching to another antipsychotic. Just sharing that this medication does work.  My blood sugar didn't go sky high, which was a huge fear of mine because I did go full blown diabetic and had to be hospitalized on other antipsychotics ( which I will not name). I did not gain any weight.",0,38,11
"Cariprazine","Easheatk","May 5, 2016","Taken for less than 1 month","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I react different than others on most Meds.  I took Vraylar for 4 days it helped with my moods but the side effects out weighed the good to it. It made me sick to my stomach, couldn't drive, had to sleep throughout the whole day, hot flashes, dehydration.  It was horrible and I couldn't handle how bad it made me feel.",0,22,11
"Cariprazine","RMCC","April 29, 2016","-","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 I have tried abilify (worked but caused massive weight gain) and latuda (worked at first, then just made me restless and agitated) and now vraylar for depression/mixed episodes in BP II.  I have only been on it for about a week, but I noticed a HUGE difference in my mood and agitation. I do not feel depressed and hopeless, and am no longer agitated at all. I hope this med continues to work! It is VERY expensive, but you can go on the website and get a savings card where you only pay $15/month.",0,40,11
"Cariprazine","Leaf4","April 12, 2016","-","<b>Vraylar (cariprazine):</b>			 My daughter has been taking Vraylar for 3 weeks after trying MANY other meds for bp depression. The others had made no difference in her sadness, only side effects. 3 days after starting vraylar she is a new person.  Happy, sleeping well. She has not needed Xanax since vraylar.  Went from crying everyday to doing schoolwork, activities with friends.  Only negative is the outrageous cost.  Working on that as it is not at all affordable.",0,57,11

Began taking Geodon for Bipolar disorder 1 and felt cured, energetic, happy. My depression was gone, as was my anxiety and I had much better work ethic. Fast forward a few weeks and the effects are subsiding. I upped my dose to 60mg but it's still not the same as initially. I've had some pretty low points. I'm hoping it still works to prevent manic episodes despite not having the antidepressant effects any longer. Considering switching to latuda, or adding an SSRI/SNRI to the mix.",0,1,1

A couple of weeks ago I was up for 60 hours non stop and this past week I've been getting 3-4 hours of sleep and have felt fully energized. The first time I took this medication I slept from 8pm to 5pm and was groggy for the 4 hours. I was awake before I went back to bed. I haven’t been tired because of it since, though. I also developed an acute dystonic reaction called an  oculogyric crisis  because of this med. I am on amandatine to stop it. This med has been a game changer for me despite this. I don’t get severely depressed anymore and my depressive episodes would be really terrible and my manic episodes would always end me up in the hospital because I'd go on a bender and overdose or I'd be up for days and be extremely irritable and cranky.",0,6,1

It has been the only antipsychotic medication I have ever used that has no side effects and no weight gain, and I sleep like a baby at night. 80 mgs at bedtime is all I take. This drug has totally changed my life for the better, and has blessed me in a hundred ways. I felt so much better after my first month on it that I went out and got a job at McDonalds restaurant and have been in management there as a trainer for the last three years. This drug has been a huge success with me when all others failed and I plan to take it for the rest of my life. I would highly recommend it at low doses to anyone. The higher doses cause horrible dizziness, so the lower doses work better. I have not heard a single voice in three years and Geodon has made a believer out of me. Bravo!",0,28,1

I'm currently thinking about switching antipsychotics, mostly because of the horrible withdrawal symptoms I get each morning and night before my next dose. Mostly bad nausea and vomiting almost every day.

On nights where I barely slept, I would wake up so terribly drowsy that I couldn’t keep my eyes open. This impaired my driving and made work and school really difficult if not impossible. My manic episodes remained the same, until I tried stopping the ziprasidone, in which they became alarmingly worse than I’d ever had them before. One night without taking ziprasidone, I had a major manic episode and was awake for over 36 hours.

I was always on Zyprexa for years and I ignored the munchies and I maintained slim). Anyways, Geodon would make me sleepy and I was able to sleep on it. Then after a couple of weeks I was feeling so restless, I couldn’t sit still and was moving a lot and I hated that side effect. Then all of a sudden it would make me feel wired and I wouldn’t sleep well for days. Then one day I took the medication earlier and a couple hours later I had a severe panic attack that I almost called the ambulance. Never again will I ever take Geodon.

While this drug did increase my motivation to exercise, I felt the side effects were too negative to continue using. It ruined my personality for some reason and interfered with my ability to make quick, witty jokes like I am normally able to do when not taking this med. For that reason, I did not like it because it turned me into a robotic, unemotional Stepford wife or something. It gave me such severe anxiety that I had frequent panic attacks and had to be treated with an anti-anxiety med to counteract the negative side effects of the Geodon. It made me have to frequently urinate or feel like I had to go at least every 20 minutes.

Also it helps me not be psychotic. It helps me stay grounded in reality. I feel calm and prepared and stable after I take it. I actually love this medicine. I take 60mg twice a day. The only side effects are late periods (up to 10 days late) at times of dosage increases, making the PMS very intense, extreme sleepiness and mild depression.

I finally had to give it up because of the constant tiredness and lack of motivation that it leaves me with.  I wake up tired, it is hard to get out of bed every morning, and I have no motivation once I do so.  Obviously I cannot lie in bed because I must work.

Being depressed has affected every part of my life and I mean every aspect. I feel that bipolar is highly underrated.

It actually seems to have an antidepressant effect and with my designation (I have Bipolar I with psychotic features) I am allowed no other antidepressants except Lamictal which doesn't do much.

"Lamictal ODT","Bisi","November 7, 2013","-","I'd give 10 stars, but after 5 yrs on this med I feel as I'm becoming dependent and immune at the same time. I take 400mg/daily and if I miss a dose by1 hr I get a horrible headache. Meanwhile for the past yr I feel as if I need to bump up the doses.  My psychiatrist said that 400mg is a very high dose and she's not comfortable exceeding. I take the dissolving tablets, which I found is a slow release and I'm able to get thru my day more easily.  Also, because this is a brand name, is very hard to find it in stock!  I definitely would recommend this drug, after trying numerous, this was the one that controlled my mood swings without side effects.",9,21,1
